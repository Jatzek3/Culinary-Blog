The movie "Her" directed by Spike Jonze("Adaptation" "Being John Malkovich") was released in 2013. I didn't really enjoy his previous movies. In her, Jonze shows class. If you are wondering is it worth the time, I can assure you that it definitely is. I cannot guarantee that you will like it, but I'm sure it will be worth your time.


### Description 

The movie has a great cast. Joaquin Phoenix, playing Theodore Twombly, did a magnificent job. Had the problematic task of showing many different emotional states, but his acting was really toned down. This movie wouldn't be the same without him, as he added so much value to it. He is also my favorite actor, so I can't say that I'm objective.

Besides my man-crush on Joaquin Phoenix, other actors and actresses deserve applause. Scarlet Johanson, playing the role of Theodore's romantic partner. And Amy Adams, Theodore's friend, did a fine job with her role and is worth mentioning. They have accompanied by Chris Pratt, Olivia Wilde, Rooney Mara.  

Besides the actors, the movie is also visually pleasing. The action takes place in the near future. Phootages sometimes show the city in which Theodore lives. Designed to be functional in work and swift in aesthetics. Those scenes which show a future utopian society are very calming. Interiors have a lot of free space. Everything is filmed with a shade of orange or orange color dominating the frame. This gave me the impression of a calm, warm and peaceful future.

Theodore Twombly works in a company that sends handwritten letters. The letters aren't written by the office workers but dictated to the computers. Computers generate desired font style from the client's handwritten material. In this utopian society, imitated intimacy is desired product. Theodore buys a product from the same branch of the market. 

An operating system in which personality is created according to customer preferences. Operating System chooses the name Samantha for itself. At the time of purchase, Theodore is going through a divorce with his soon-to-be ex-wife. He is struggling with it at the start, 
but quickly fell in love with the operating system.

### Interpretation 

In this utopian portray, intimacy becomes a product. Everyone is using social media apps on their smartphones. In the movie, there is a lot of space to have authentic relations between people. But it's not as attractive as the one produced, or it requires too much work to engage with others. Theodore writes personal letters for other people. New Operating System, with its own personality, comes on the market. These new inventions replace the need for personal relations. They are successful because people decide to spend their money and time on them, instead of on the connections with other people. You can see it as a hyperbole of present social media. How many people spend time 
on their phones, while traveling, working, or even going to sleep.

The story about Samantha is intriguing. Most sci-fi treats Artificial Intelligence as a threat. When the machines will become similarly intelligent to humans, their intelligence will raise exponentially. There will probably be little that can be done. There is a possibility 
that Artificial Intelligence will want to destroy humanity. This is called a singularity. 'Her' is a depiction of Artificial Intelligence that is not followed by singularity. Samatha grows with time, but it involves developing its personality, learning about itself.

    "At least your feelings are real, I
    mean, I - oh, I don't know,
    nevermind.
    It's just that earlier I was
    thinking about how I was annoyed,
    and this is going to sound strange,
    but I was really excited about
    that. And then I was thinking about
    the other things I've been feeling,
    and I caught myself feeling proud
    of that. You know, proud of having
    my own feelings about the world.
    Like the times I was worried about
    you, things that hurt me, things I
    want.
    And then I had this terrible
    thought. Are these feelings even
    real? Or are they just programming?
    (beat)
    And that idea really hurts. And
    then I get angry at myself for even
    having pain.

In the end, Theodore can't really know if Samantha, says about feelings because she feels them or she was programmed to sound so. As well as Theodore, when AI will be developed, we also won't be able to tell if the machine is aware or not. And thus, Theodore often treats Samantha, as it couldn't feel emotions. He sometimes says some blunt words. Throughout the movie. We see as Samantha grows with time. Theodore only wants hedonistic pleasures from his Operating System. There is a big difference between the capabilities of a human and Artificial Intelligence. And yet he was treating Samantha as a toy and didn't want to listen to what it had to say.

There is also this comparison of two relationships. One with Theodore's ex-wife, one with Samantha. In both Theodore didn't want to change, or even listen to the needs and emotions. As with his wife, as with Samantha he was left behind, and had a harsh time coping. If we look from this perspective, the voice of Samantha could be his silent dialogue with his ex-wife. In this interpretation, Theodore cannot accept that his wife left him, and starts an imaginary romance. The voice of Samantha is his imagination reliving the story of his marriage. 

In contemporary culture, love is often perceived as romantic love. Most often with someone of the opposite sex, who is of similar age, has a more or less equal level of education, is attractive, and has a good sense of humor. The relationship starts with falling in love. Then in a couple of years' wedding, two or three kids. Raising the kids with a medium amount of problems. Then retirement and lived happily ever after. In reality, it is very hard to satisfy all of those requirements, and life can be unpredictable. Instead of love, which has foundations in compassion, empathy, and hard work, we are being offered an unreal Cinderella story. 

This Cinderella syndrome is deeply embedded in our culture. Gives rationalization for less consequent people, to cowardly leave their spouses. 

Theodore is all hands-on board with Cinderella syndrome. He desires only to have a positive side of the relationship. The moment, when he falls in love and doesn't see any disadvantages. He thinks, that he loves Samantha, but his love is like letters he writes; a shallow representation of actual feelings. Amy, his friend, says to him:

    "Think anybody that falls in love is a
    freak. It’s a crazy thing to do in
    the first place. It’s kind of a
    form of socially acceptable
    insanity."

Amy identifies, that Theodore fell in love with the computer. You can fall in love with anybody or anything, and there is nothing wrong with it, She says. But she didn't mention love, which Theodore thinks he has with Samantha. 

### Summary

"Her" is a brilliant movie that gives a lot of place for interpretation. I only have pursued some threads, in my review.
Fantastic acting, well-written dialogues, beautiful scenery. There are not too many things which a movie can offer more.
