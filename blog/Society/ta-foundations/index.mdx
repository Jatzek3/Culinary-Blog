Transactional Analysis became well know theory when Eric Berne released his book "Games People Play: The Psychology of Human Relationships" 1964. It quickly becomes a bestseller and is a worthwhile lecture to this day. Eric Berne layout the fundaments of his theory in this book and gave a few examples of how Transactional Analysis works in day-to-day life. We can attribute the roots of the Theory to Freud. The Id, Ego, and Superego resemble Bernes Child, Adult, and Parent very well.

### Description

In Transactional Analysis, there are three states: Child, Adult, and Parent. During personal interactions, we come in one of those states.
- Child is our emotional, irrational side. 
- Adult is a person who perceives and is attendant. 
- Parent is a state of ego, that thinks in terms of rules and necessities, in an abstract way.

When two people communicate, both can take different states of ego. It is independent of the formal role they pose. Boss can be in a Child ego state towards his secretary, which he adores her. She can reject him and be in the adult state of ego. Parent playing with his child can be in Child state of ego. The kid can act as a general of an army, and be in a Parent state of ego. 

Besides functional relations, there are also dysfunctional. Games in which people participate, though it always ends in a net loss. There are reasons in which people can partake in such relations. Often the reasons are unconscious and satisfy some kind of emotional need. I will show two examples of Games:

### Examples of games 

#### "Poor me" (From source 3.)

##### Purpose
Primary: Sympathy displacement
Secondary: Social capital

##### Gameplay 
- A gets into a situation where they feel hard done by, where the world in general or someone, in particular, is unfair to them
- A tells the story to B, lamenting how unlucky they are, how unfair things are.
- B offers sympathy and concern.
- B also now has gained some social capital from this and can ask for something in return

##### Discussion

This is an archetypal victim game, although victimhood is at the heart of many other games. People who play victim in various situations often get their reward later on in poor me sessions where an accomplice offers them sympathy. Victims also get the benefit of absolving themselves from responsibility. Nothing is felt to be really their fault (although they may berate themselves). They are victims of circumstance and other people. They enjoy the anticipation of hope of rescue in the manner of the helpless child.

If there is nobody else, then an alternative is to play the second person themselves. This lack of support, of course, just gives another reason to feel 'poor me'.

A common response from B that balances out the social capital is to also do a 'Poor me'. The game can then become a to-and-fro discussion of how terrible and downtrodden they are.

Note that there is a big difference between the victim in a game and a 'real-life' victim. The game victim enters into the state voluntarily (albeit often subconsciously) and gains some comfort from this state, as described above. The real victim is the person mugged on the streets or an orphan in a war-torn country, who has no choice: they are made a victim by circumstance or the actions of others.

##### So what?
If you are happy to be the shoulder to cry on for other people, then you can gain social capital and ask for something in return.

Also, watch out for becoming the person about whom A is complaining.

#### Status Game (From source 3.)

##### Purpose

Increase one's own social status, relative to others.
Decrease others' social status, relative to one's own.
Gain power and influence.

##### Gameplay
- A says something.
- B says something that positions B as superior to A, usually in the subject A has brought up.
- or, B says something that positions A as inferior.
- or, A and B position C as inferior to both of them.

##### Discussion

As a tribal species, we have a great concern for our position in the 'pecking order' and spend a great deal of time subtly positioning ourselves, often within polite verbal battles. Entire conversations may be purely about status, even when they may seem to be inconsequential.

Status is a relative thing. We do not have status relative to a fixed standard but to other people. We thus see ourselves as superior and inferior relative to other people.

Having higher social status means we have the power to direct others and take things from them, originally including food and mates. In normal society, it is seen in higher status people interrupting others and overriding their views and decisions.

There is also a reversal on the Status Game (the Modesty Game) where a person positions themself as inferior to others but in doing so is claiming superiority. Effectively what is said is:

'I cannot claim to be superior without risking others continuing the game by trying to reduce my status, so I will send a signal that I am modest, which means I know my superiority but am being considerate of others and so actually deserve to be given higher status.'

There is a Power Game, often used by acknowledged and prospective leaders, which appears as a Modesty Game. The person positions themself at a lower status whilst everyone knows that if they actually treat that person as if they were lower status they will suffer from the use of the other person's power. Power games often deliberately break rules simply as a demonstration

##### So what?
Watch any conversation and you will very likely see status games going on. When you are aware of them, you can then choose what to do.

Manage your own status games where you may be so concerned at gaining status you fail to persuade others.

Sometimes you can give status in order to get something in return. At other times, you need to gain status in order to be able to influence others.

### About the foundations

More or less, that's the basics of TA, which Eric Berne described. The book is relatively short and has described many games. Some of which still can be found on different therapies. Transactional Analysis had been developing. New features were added, many games through the years were devalued. The roots itself of TA are interesting, and reading Eric Berne's book can give you an intriguing perspective on people's behavior. TA today is deeper and closer to reality, in my opinion.
