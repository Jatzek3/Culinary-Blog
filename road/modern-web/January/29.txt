Anpther day of learning to program without programing. 
Some could argue that its, not the way to learn practical skill, but besides practice and
skill in programming is also important to learn theory behind this. It can save you from 
many misktakes. Today Im learning Chapter about Scripting CSS. Beside remembering 4 main 
CSS posititions, I had the first contanct with Box model explanation. 
How top, right, bottom, left and width, height. I heard about the trich how to memorize
the order of top, right, bottom, left in many CSS general properties. Just remember Trouble
wich have the constants in apropriate clockwise order. 
So generally there was a little bit of CSS. Exsplantion why CSS in JS have other syntax.
And ClassName also got some place for those who write in React

I went to electronic shop to buy ethernet cables endings. I hade very nice chat with an 
informatician, who showed me how little I know about electronics. He was very o and shared a litte about his worldview tith me.

I then instaled Internet in my house, with neighbour who have private network. We managed to instal 
everything, but didn't managed to get the internet working. I supose it is beacouse of very old 
router, very poorly setup. There is also possibility beacouse of Windows settings, but I think
Its not the case becouse Linux have no connetction also. I restored the windows setting to starting ones
and very many of my apps need to be reinstalled. But hey if im gonna need them, I'm gonna get them.
So in the end some rubbish, and time got wasted.
