footnotes:
- important! potato pancakes have to be grated. If you have blender you could
teoritiacally use it to save time, but it would spoil the essence of the meal.
- I sometimes added smoked paprika to my pancakes, Its optional and dont really
improve the dish. I recommend using only salt and pepper
- A litle of MSG never hurts in my opinon.
