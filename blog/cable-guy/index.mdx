After a breakup with a girl, Steven have to return to his unfurnished
appartment. During first few days he meets a cable guy which is 
very eager for his company.Cable guy (Jim Carrey) plays
 a role of very weird acting, lonely and
socially awkward character, and most of the plot of the movie 
revolves around the adventures which are the result of his traits.
Main character is also metally ill, which unfortunatelly is portayed
in stigmatizing way.

The movie is about loneliness and in my opinion about perception of
lonely, not well socialized people in society. Its directed and shot
in comedic way but in when you look behind the facade, then you will
see lot of suffering, striving for company and closeness of others.
Main character indeed is highly skilled socially and can easilly
mingle with other people, but it requires from him to play a role 
and act in accteptable way and this isn't authentic.  
Main character don't just want company of others, he want to have
meaningfull and authentic relation. Want to be simple accepted despite
of his awkwardness

The movie don't do much good for people, which are struggling to
maintain relationships, becouse of their traits. Cable guy was lisping
which could lead to his ostracism. The loneliness then influence a 
person so he start acting in awkward way. Cable guy was watching movies
and I supose he started acting in the way actors in movies behave.
The plot in a movie shows, that when you engage in people which
act in a weird way, you can have very serious negative consequences 
from it.

So the movie shows the ostracism of some people, but it empowers it 
instead of crtitize. I think Ben Stiller who was directing the movie, 
didn't knew how to do it and gave different moral meaning in the end.
To not spend so much time in front of the screen, which is very sad 
becouse there were so many more lessons to take out of the plot. The
postmodernistic autoreference feature was to attractive to the director.
