Spaghetti Bolognese is a good idea for sunday dinner
when you meet with your family and want to cook something good what everyone knows and enjoys. I'm used to
cooking it in a quite simpler way without carrot, celery, and ground pork instead of beef. I also advise you to use pork, because in
my opinion ground beef has to strong taste and can be too fatty. I once used ground beef and wasn't happy with the result.
It can be a good idea to mix the ground pork with ground beef.

### Ingredients:
- 1 onion 
- 1 carrot 
- 3-4 garlic cloves
- 400-500g of ground meat
- 500g of tomato passata 
- 3 teaspoon tomato puree 
- 0,5l of beef stock 
- salt, pepper
- 4 balls of allspice
- 2 bay leaves
- papardelle, tagliatelle or penne pasta
- Grated cheese to serve

### Method:

1. Thinly dice the onion and carrots, slice the garlic. Pour some oil on the pan
2. Put the onions on the pan on medium for 5 minutes. Afterward, add
garlic and carrots for 10-15 minutes.
3 If your Pan is big enough (It should hold at least 2 liters), put the meat into vegetables. Otherwise, put some oils and vegetables into the bigger pot on medium heat 
and cook the meat on the smaller pan until the meat is not raw.
4. Transfer the meat to vegetables, add tomatoes, 0,5 liter of beef stock, salt, pepper, bay leaves, and allspice. Bring the temperature to high until boiling and then turn it to low.
5. Cook the sauce for about 2 hours, check for density and add tomato puree. 
Spice it to your taste. 
6. Serve with pasta and grated cheese

Enjoy your meal!

### Footnotes:
- I always made the this souce with spaghetti. Since spaghetti is so commonly associated with bolognese ragu. 
But it is better to cook it with pasta which made the sauce and pieces of meat stick to it.
