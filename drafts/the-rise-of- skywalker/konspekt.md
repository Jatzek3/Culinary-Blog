### Introduction

- So you killed hundreds of people, destroeyd a planet and want to get to Jedi heaven!?
- Yes Sir - Says Ben Solo.
Green sign "Access Granted" appears on the screen.
- Something not right. Let me check it out. Oh yes. Everything is clear now. You are a descendent of Anakin Skywalker, the famous Darth Vader. Step right in, Sir, we have a seat for you ready near your uncle, and other two Jedis which havent been portayed in the movies with their murderous nature. But don't you worry. They slew hundreds of innocent humanoids, creatures and stormtroopers.

### The Rise of Skywalker


- Crossbows are still popular weapon in the World of Jedi, when there is technologoy that could destroy a planet.
- the epiodes 7 and 8 gave the Saga many new revolutionary changes, which weren't so well accepted by Star Wars fan community. Episode 9 consists mainly from references to previous Episodes. 
- Black man and a woman are still leading characters. White man are still dominating sex and gender in space. Though the First Order specializes in searching and recruiting them across the galaxy.
- C3PO an R2D2 outsurvives any character across the whole saga, and now with BB8 will be sideactors in next Disney production. They dont have too much fighting capabilities but they manage to get out of any dengerous situation without a scratch.
- Nostalgic Kylo Ren repairs his mask, which he wears without any reason besides (tęsknota) for his grandfather, Darth Vader. Such a sensitive fellow. I would recomend him to buy 1 or 2 of those mask, if he would "accidentaly" broke one. 
- R2D2 still have loading diods when he sends short text message, while dark side can comunicate freely and instantaniuosly using holograms.
- Speeders have now tracks, though they were flying in episode six. They also have very dengerous catapult, whih sends flying stormtroopers with jetpacks in the air. Im sure that, if the stoormtroopers can fly they also can get into air without very odd catapult. 
- R2D2 suicidydely try to detonate a tank, with gas. Luckily it's a droid so it very fortunately fly in to the stormtroopers speeder.
As Leya says "Never underestimate a droid", which is a rethorical trick to seal the obvious logic mistake.
- Ray in order to heal the serpent gives her lightsaber to Finn, but still manage to heal it with one hand. 
- If you are reading this, then certainly you know that fighting with small fleet against an Armada of Star Destroyers is a suicide. Otherwise you wouldn't last through high school. General Poe Dameron yet manages to get out of any situation against all odds.
- Horsemen in space, shows that Star Wars are more a Fantasy story then Sci-Fi. There is nothing scintific to this kind of cavalary.
- Why the Coneface? 3 droids aren't enough?
- Han Solo isn't force ghost, yet he speaks post mortem to Kylo Ren. Why Han Solo not Leya? Leya was force sensitive, so she couold become force ghost, and she just died after Kylo Rens fight with Rey.
- Fleet of Star destroyers have problems with launchinh\g of the planet. They cant say which way Up is. I wont mention (składu) of the fleet which consist only from Star Destroyers a Batlleship (odpowiednik) for modern era warships.
- While fighting Kylo Ren turn back, and let one of the gard hit him in his lightsaber on his his back. I didn't wanted to analyze the lightsaber battles, but it's such a dumb move I just had to mention it.
- Emperror is very undecisive about his heritage, He starts with Kylo Ren, to have a short episode with Rey, and at last decide that he will remain Emperror. No one wants to take the power beside the Sith.

### Good sides

- Use of the force is portayed nicely, with Rey using and explaining light side force heal, and dark side force lightining.
- This part is more entertaining then the episodes 7 and 8.
- The references to other episodes are neatly woven in to the plot.
- Though the screenwriters had much fun with the script, the heroes and their groeth, are well portayed and consistent. Kylo Ren acts, as he finally made his mind. The doubts of Rey are belivable, and it is pleasurable experirence to watch her.

### Theory - social stratification in Star Wars

1. Different paths of Leia Organa and Luke Skywalker. Leia Married, had children and become the leader of the resistance thanks to 'being born' in the family from upper spheres. Despite doing practically nothing throughout the series, beside marrying the athug and a smuggler
1.2 Luke despite destroing the Death Star and risking his life many times, achieved almost nothing. Never married, and at the end of episode 6 he run to the desolation, to drink milk from strangly looking creatures, and I think want to recreate happy times of his childhood, just on less sandy planet.

### The Disney Fairy Tale problem

- show the world divided into dual opposite sides - the good - rebels, the bad - sith
- The underdogs, the good side, thanks to persistence wins with the Dark side
- The good side has all the virtues, it's beutifull, funny and the traditional values are on their side, while the bad evil side has as much vices as is possible
