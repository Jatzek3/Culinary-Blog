- Martin scorsesse
- Leonardo di Caprio
About the movie 
- Plot
Interpretation
- Zimbardo experiment extended.
	- Three players - Rachel Solando, Edward Daniels and Nazi guy
	- rest of the staff are actors which are meant to create a role play, according to rachel solando by the fire appearence, rechel solando is speaking the truth
	- When the interrogated woman, which killed his husband whith an axe write "Run" to teddy daniels we could interpret it as she became one of the patients, after a scenario was played on her.
	- the only person who isnt the actor is the captain of the ship
	- closed and controlled enviorement perfect for creating narrative
	- The narrative could be played once again, and not for the marshal, but its recreated for another patient this time teddy daniels. ("The Law of four. I love this part")
	- He has a memory of killing Nazi guards, but the psychiatrist tell him otherwise.
	- Nazi guy a player which is the adversary of teddy daniels, praises violence and seem drunk while driving a car. Hes scenario teaches him violence, like a guard from Zimbardo experiment
	- Teddy Daniels, "the good guy" also uses violence but in search of the truth, to serve humanity.
	- "Is it better to die as a good person, or to live as a monster" - may mean that he preferrs to die then to live as an actor/monster of this theater
	- why when teddy daniels shoot his gun fires, and Ben Kinsley is still living? It shouldnt fire in first place - it implicates simulated reality. "Then blast away. Its the only way to get you of this island" - Ben Kinsley
	- Why he remeber george noyce? 
	- the name Andrew laedis - Does the screenwriters of the action always creates annagrams of other actors?  (It would be funny if the only thing changed in the scenarios would be names to fit the players and "rule of four")
	- Where from is the "ugly guy" Andrew Laedis come from?
	- Is Teddy Daniels really a monster if he killed his wife, when she killed their 3 kids. That doesent make any sense. He also was an ex soldier and a cop which makes him very prone to agrresion. Killing of his wife could be seen in this circumstances as understandable.
Teddy Daniels was in Ward C, and tried to run with George Noyce. This lead to creating this scenario for him so he would Live as an actor in play or was lobotomized killed.
Lighthouse place outside of the island, where things outside of the play happens. Why build a lighthouse on lower altituted then the cliffs of Island? Can be fictional, a metaphore - A symbolism of a lighthouse.
Rachel Solando, the blond one, is the imagination created by the screenwriters.
Why the lit cigarette and a body on the feet of the cliff, after his patrner found Andrew Laedis papers(Teddy didnt took them). The papers then fly to him when he climbs of a cliff? (The symulated reality try to fix the broken narrative by Teddy)? Chuck presumably came before and fell of a cliff?
Why he ask Chuck the same question as on the start? Why would Teddy mind about the weather in Portland at this moment? Chuck gives him the same answer? - Check if his words are authenthic? At the begging of the movie Teddy, says that there are very few Marshals ("How long youve been in Marshals" "4years" "So you know how small it easy). When Chuck take of weapon Teddy notices his poor handlin. And I think there are many more clues which indicates that Chuck isnt a person which he want to appear.
Why the rats? narrative defense of psyche/simulation? Real rachel Solando knew from the start that his Marshal even though she never met him.   
Main psychiatrist(Ben Kingsley) smokes pipe but carries also ciggarettes, which he wants to give to Teddy. As rachel said the drugs are in meals, coffee, ciggarettes.
Main psychitrist suggest that Teddy didn't came with a partner. 
Burning tie an destroing the car in the fire where a girl dies with fake rachel, could symbolize Teddy awarness of the narrative which he was indoctrinated.   
From where the psychiatrist have the exact transcript of the dialog beetwen George Noyce and Teddy? George Noyce told them, simulated reality or narrative of the script? Chuck played that he didn't knew about the dialog.


Why create an artificial reality to make person belive in the truth. Much more convincing is making Teddy believe in the artificial narration. Teddy though keep coming back to the truth in which he belives.
The narrative is so difficult to take in, and Teddy is such a hard brave personality that it would make perfect experimental conditions for manpulation on consiousness.
