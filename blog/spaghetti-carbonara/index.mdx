Spaghetti Carbonara is a very simple dish which can be all made in the time your pasta is cooking and also is very tasty. It is hard 
to believe that a simple recipe can produce such a fine dish.
I won't be using original Italian ingredients, since they are expensive, and 
the pasta from the recipe is delicious.

Ingredients
- 2 eggs
- 50g of cheese
- 100g of bacon or sausage
- 250g of spaghetti pasta

Spices
- salt
- pepper
- 1tsp of Maggi/soy sauce

1. On the pan put your diced meat and fry it for a couple of minutes
2. Boil the water in the pot. Add pasta and cook until it's al dente
3. In the meantime put grated very thinly grated cheese, two raw eggs,
one pinch of salt, Maggi/soy sauce, and two pinches of pepper.
4. Stir the egg mixture well, so it will have about uniform consistency.
5. When your pasta is ready, strain it and quite quickly get it back into
the pot. Take the egg mixture and pour it into the pasta while stirring it intensively
for about 2 minutes till the whole pasta will be coated in the sauce.
If you won't execute this step properly your dish will become scrambled eggs with spaghetti.
6. Add the meat from the pan and stir it a little bit more.

Some footnotes

- Some people add cream to the recipe. I think this is inappropriate
because the dish has a creamy taste on its own.
- I heard from one cook that instead of using whole eggs, You can use the egg yolks. I didn't try it, but it seems like an interesting idea, which I can use someday.
- I read on the internet a recipe that added garlic, I wouldn't rather do that.
- If you have some mushrooms you can add them sliced to the meat. It is 
good combinations
