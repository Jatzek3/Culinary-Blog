### Introduction

Lately, Netflix aired the final episode of Money Heist. As with most series, it was ready to be watched by me. 

I don't like to watch previous seasons just to remember what happened in some TV show five years ago. I prefer to watch it from the beginning to the end. Some may interpret it as not being able to delay gratification. I call watching movie series five years in a row and waiting for each episode, thoughtless self-harm. Time is precious. If you are to throw it away on watching series or movies, do it efficiently.

If you are to do it efficiently,  should you watch "Money Heist"?. Yes, I think so. The show may not be the brightest piece of art that has ever been filmed. But it is an enjoyable and engaging experience. 

The series consists of five seasons. Each has around ten episodes. I did not know any actors beforehand, but it's understandable. It's a Spanish production and not a high-budget movie. Just a Netflix series, so they won't employ prominent (or even regular) Hollywood actors. Nevertheless, some actors manage to create memorable characters. 

- Álvaro Morte - "Profesor" - Chuck norris in glasses. Very neatly portrayed perfectionist, who shows the balls when it is needed.
- Pedro Alonso - "Berlin" - Very chaotic yet cool-headed. An amoral person with a taste for art.
- Jaime Lorente - "Denver" - I liked him. He played the role of the thug with an awkward laugh and some emotional scenes.
- Alba Flores - "Nairobi" -  I liked this petit, just girl with a big heart.
- Fernando Soto - Ángel - Played the role of a policeman, who while having truth on his side collects all the whips. A noble person with good knowledge of art, of which no one would suspect him.  

### The series

The series is about a group of criminals who gave themselves nicknames of different cities. I saw some stereotypical resemblance in specific cities to their beares traits. 

They want to make a heist on Spanish mint. They argue: "it won't be stealing if we print the money for ourselves". "The professor" should know, that releasing this printed money would resolve inflation, and thus would be stealing from everybody in European Union.

The series fits the taste of the average Netflix customer. It's well-shot. The plot develops over time and keeps in suspense. Throughout the series, we are constantly surprised by new facts about the members of the heist crew's pasts.
    
On the other hand, characters are very static and don't develop over time. They seem shallow, and their emotions very theatrical. In every place possible we are presented with moral indifferentism and relativism. That should be adequate for a band of thieves. But the series is made to sympathize with those criminals as if they would be a team of underdogs or 'Robin Hoods'.
    
### Summary

The ideological part of the movie isn't it strong part. There is no place for people with traditional values in this series. Even if someone stands by the law, he is portrayed as evil, or in the best case naive. While shallow, meaningless forms and empty phrases are represented as full of glamour on moral high ground. I doubt that the creators wanted to show that a lack of any standards leads to crime, jail, or death (which it does). 

The series isn't very educating, and I would restrict this availability to Spain on Netflix. I don't want to encounter people, which use oneliners or nickname's from Money Heist like "Tokio", "Berlin", or "Stockholm" (I wouldn't mind meeting Toronto. But he doesn't have any lines in the screenplay).

The plot is interesting, and the series is engaging. I recommend watching the Money Heist to anyone, who wouldn't give himself a nickname, or try to impersonate a character from a movie. All in all, even if "philosophically naive", watching Money Heist is still a series worth time spending.
