### "My life is nothing but a comedy"

This is a period, when Arthur develops philosophy to fight back against the unjust oppersion and social system. He takes revenge on people who harmed him, and arbitraryly punish people who took advantage of him.

Arthur accepts his joker authenthic personality and is truly happy. As a new person don't have any romorse to kill bullies or people who oppress the weak.
Everytime he kills he feel relieved.

Policemen in the subway are a symbol of the oppression.

Joker becomes his true self just before entering the Scene o Murray show.

### Couple of happy Thoughts

1. Id, Ego, SuperEgo - Joker starts to be himself when he (porzuci) social rules, and starts acting how "he want and feel about people"

2. His mother represents, self control and obeying the rules of society. She was a person closest to him, but lied and made him suffer. She represent the hipocricy and the harm which social rules couse to the disabled and poor people.

0. Stairs he climb heavilly upwards in the begiing of the movie, and as a Joker he dances down from them happily as he could ever be

9. Rats, and facade social rules symbolizes the sickness in which the society is functioning. When joker goes on the killing spree, the social rules are thrown out and the riots opposing the social hierarchy start to rise.

1. Wayne is the face of the rotting social system, hypocrisy.

9. television, shows and acting represent the imaginary world in he exist the more insane he gets. And in this world everthing is exagerated and don't have to obey to social rules.

8. Murrays show always on when on his mother is present - represatation of father figure

6. Poster of "Dictator" - by charlie chaplin in one of the sceens. Dictator is a grotesque comedy, which shows the history of Hynkel. At the end he stops acting in the comedic way and point out the sensless violence which rule the society.

0. Ending song is That’s Life by Frank Sinatra. The lyrics and upbeat happy tune about failures in life, is nice summary of the jokers motto "Lets put a smile on that face"
