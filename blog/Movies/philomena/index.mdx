Philomena's plot is about an older woman who seeks a child
which she abadoned in her youth. She is accompanied by a reporter which writes
a novel about her and her child.

For me, two worlds collide in the story. One the world
of values, modesty, honesty, and sincerity represented by Philomena, which 
is contrasted by the Catholic's nurse insincerity, pragmaticism, and punishing 
view of morality. On the other hand, there is the world of glamour, class and 
appearances represented by the reporter, and in the background of his 
story are lies, envy, and insincerity of his previous colleagues.

So we got two opposites worlds of values, which are bound together
by lies and hypocrisy. In the middle of this world meets our two heroes. In the search
of the son of Philomena, who was gay and a prominent member
of the conservative party under the Reagan presidency.

The story is based on facts, and the story of Philomena's son is real. Some
facts surely were added to the detective/reporter side of the story. Some things probably were colorized 
and I'm quite certain Catholic Church was accused of more then happened in reality.
