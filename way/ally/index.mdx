I finally got a second job, as WCAG Auditor. 

I was feeling good with the company, even though my role was only slightly
tied to frontend and programming. I was checking if the websites were, built according to Web Content Accessibility Guidelines(WCAG), which in short
means if they were accessible for people with disabilities. It wasn't an easy job because I had to construct my first document on my own, using only materials, which I came on my own. I'm proud of my first report,
It looked nice, thanks to my colleague's graphics. It was acceptable for
management and fulfilled all the criteria for the WCAG report.

Unfortunately, during work, I was struggling with a health condition and 
couldn't continue the work in the company. Overall I have very good memories
of Grupa AF, a very good atmosphere, good working conditions, a lot of 
understanding, and great communication.

### Skills Acquired:
- Advaced Accessibility
- Insight into commercial programming lifecycle
