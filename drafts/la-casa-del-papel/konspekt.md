2. The series

    - The series is about a group of crimanals which gave themselve nickname of the City's. I saw some some stereotypical resemblance in specific cities, and thier beares traits. But I can be overinterpreting, and I doubt that some other people will.
    - These criminals want to make a heist on Spanish mint. So they won't be stealing from anyone if they just print those money for themselves(LOL) -> A little bit of a hole in the plot. Becouse very intelliget "the proffesor" should know, that releasing this printed money would resolve in inflation, and thus would be stealing from whole European Union.
    - The series can be easilly digested by avarege Netflix consumer. It is well filmed. Plot develop over time and keeps in suspense. Throught the series we are constatly being suprised by new facts about the members of heist crews pasts.
    
    - On the other side characters are very static, and they don't develop so much over time. They seem shallow. Their emotions seem very teatricall. 
    - In every place possible we are pressented with moral indiferentism and relativism. Which is often accompanied by glitz. This should be adequate for a band of thieves. But the series is made this way to symphatize with those criminals. As if they would be team of underdogs and 'Robin Hoods'.
    - Intentional overrepresantation of sexual minorities, free sex, showing the policeman as the foul adversaries, 

    - Spanish cienema have this vice that its often filmed in its native language. I dislike it becouse dubbing its ofen worser quality than original. You have to concentrate on subtiles and movie if you prefer them over the dubbing. And Spanish cinema have Del'Toro, Almodovar and now Money Heist all of them in Spanish.
