### Introduction

I've previously read the Dublin/Ireland diptych of the same author. You can find the review [here](https://theyellowpages.live/blog/ireland/)
The History of Ireland, England, and London are strongly linked. You can read about the same events but from different perspectives.

I found "London" more interesting than "Dublin & Ireland". I find historical fiction entertaining. In Poland, we have "Trylogia" by Henryk Sienkiewicz, which is entertaining and educational. Henryk Sienkiewicz lived in the XIX century and was one of the authors who influenced the rise of Polish national identity.

'Trylogia' and Edward Rutherfurd's books are time well spent. 'London' is even more captivating than 'Dublin/Ireland'.

### Author 

Edward Rutherfurd is a pen name of Francis Edward Wintle. He was born in 1948. Then he graduated from the University of Cambridge, and Stanford Bussiness School. After graduating, he worked in political research, bookselling, and publishing. He left his career in 1983 and started writing "Sarum", a historical novel that describes events of over ten thousand years.

Sarum was published in 1987 and became an international best-seller. Remained for 23 weeks on New York Times Bestseller List. After this, he wrote seven more books which became bestselling titles.1

### The story

The book is long, and it can take some time to go through it. It has about a thousand pages. The font is smaller than in Dublin/Ireland, but I consider it more interesting. There are three maps of London in different epochs at the start of the book (which is not so useful). Genealogical ties of the heroes of the book ( which are handy) are printed on the cover at the end of the book. That could be an issue. I didn't notice them until I was halfway through the book.

The action of the book takes place in London. It spans from the Roman founding of the city to XXth-century events. Each chapter tells a separate story, but the characters are connected by bloodline. So as in other E. Rutherfurd books, there are six families, which representatives are the heroes of the books. Many members of each family have similar traits. We can foresee what kind of behavior we can expect from a certain person, on the grounds of their origins.

London shows us how social interactions changed through time. How feudalism, and wealth influenced social interactions. At the start of the book, there weren't many discrepancies between the people. With time we can see how some families gain wealth and power or lose their position in the hierarchy. That is one of the most valuable features of the book.

We can observe how the capital of England influenced the monarchy in some chapters. The parliament, at certain times, played a major role in English politics. We can read how characters influenced both the parliament and also city council.

The books led me to some beneficial conclusions. The first was how the stories we tell shape our reality. At the start of the book, the world was uncomplicated, and very little impacted human interactions. With time this started to change, and relations are more complex, and more artificial social constructs influenced them. This can be noticed throughout different chapters of the book. That change through time is depicted in one book and is the main takeaway.

The second conclusion was how drastically changed in the last two or three hundred years. It's easy to point out,  from the first flight by the Wright brothers to launching a person into space only seventy years have passed. But I would like to show, that from feudalism we went to the universal right to vote in about a quarter of millennia. There were cases in history when democracy had its place,  but it was rare and possible only on small scale. 


### Summary

London besides being interesting, educating, and fun to read, also granted me an experience that isn't easily achievable. To be in touch with history throughout the years, having the possibility to see the changes. You can go to the museum and experience the reality of certain times. You can get a good understanding of what happened throughout history. But there are not so many ways to understand the changes in time. I was aware of the events described in the book, but reading about them gave me a new wholesome perspective. And I'm truly happy to have read it.

I recommend London to anyone, especially to those interested in history. Reading the book takes a lot of time, but It's worth it.
