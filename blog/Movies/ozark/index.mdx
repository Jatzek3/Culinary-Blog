### Introduction

Ozark is one of the popular TV series in which ordinary people get involved with the mafia. In Better Call Saul, the hero unintentionally starts to work for the Mob. In Ozark, it's the same, but instead of a lawyer, protagonist Martin Byrde(Jason Bateman) is an accountant.  

The final of a four-season-long series was aired at the end of this April(2022). It's a thrilling and dark series diligently filmed.

The movie cast was up to the mark. Jason Bateman, beside playing main role, also directed some of the episodes. He was well suited for the Ozark; playing diligent and patient accountant, who don't let emotions drive His actions. 
His wife Wendy (Laura Linney) had demanding part to play. If well played it would deserve an Oscar. I fink that it was beyond the reach of Laura Linney.
Julia Garner, like Jason Bateman, did a great job with her role of Ruth Langmore, a petite redneck girl. She also starred in Inventing Anna, a recently aired series.


### Story and the world

The story begins when cartel people start to seek revenge on Martin's accountant firm. His co-worker, and close friend, took some of the cartel's money. They found out about this behavior and wanted to kill everybody. Marty promised to launder five hundred million dollars over five years. Thats why Hi and his family lives.
There's no specific reason why Byrdes had to leave Chicago and move to Ozark. I don't recollect the reason, besides the cartel having influence in the drug industry in this city.
The world of Ozark is very diversified. There is a redneck family of drug entrepreneurs, which sell heroin on on-boat masses, an FBI agent who falls in love with a man during work, and there is Bipolar disorder portrayed, and these are only some examples.

Plot often depict people stepping out of their roles. But choices are very often justified. Even if someone does something unexpected, the story goes on with the weight of it. Characters are influenced by their decisions. The show gives much more things that are hard to expect.

I liked the climate of Ozark. It shows the world from a different perspective. Even if there is much more death, there are also family issues or grudges. The series reflects my imagined portrayal of the rural South of the US, and also I think it relies on it. The cartel people's roles also fit modern pop culture image of mobsters.
And in this place, are placed the Byrde's. Large Town, middle class. They would have watched the Ozark if they wouldn't actually weren't heroes of the show. 

### Summary

Ozark isn't a series that you would watch with family. It also isn't a series that necessarily would watch with your spouse. But if you got the time, you got fired, or your pet died, or someone didn't respond to your call, go ahead. Some people got it worse. It's well-produced series to which you can somehow relate.
