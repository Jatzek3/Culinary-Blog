If you're interested in Frontend technologies, you had to
hear the name "React," it's so popular. React is the core technology in which this website is built. It is very much liked in the developer community and is also one of the most popular technologies on the web, and it is very rarely the case. It is developed, maintained, and used by Facebook, so, besides the support of the developer community, it also has huge support from the IT industry.

Ok. But what is React?
Developers and maintainers of React call it "A JavaScript library for building user interfaces". In the subtitle, I called it a framework. 
Frameworks are often big, robust applications, which give you project structure
and it takes some time to learn them. They have numerous amount of tools incorporated in them,
and writing them is usually very normalized.
On other hand, there are libraries, which help you solve certain problems, like dates, styling, etc. In this case, react is more like a library, because it's small and lets you build components, of which you will be comprised.

But React has an ecosystem, which supports it. There are many technologies which almost always used within react applications, but are not included in React itself. Thanks to this
React started to be a center of frameworks like Gatsby or Next.js. 

So what does React itself do:
- it checks if on your site there was a change on the website, and modify only this one thing (if not for this
everything had to be rewritten)
- while you are browsing the website it remembers the changes, in the application 
- it helps developers write code in an easy way 
- It gives the user a good experience thanks to loading once, and if a page change on the website, there will be no rerendering of the page.
