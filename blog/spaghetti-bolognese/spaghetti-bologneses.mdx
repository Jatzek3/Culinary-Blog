Spaghetti Bolognese is a good idea for sunday dinner,
when you meet with your familly and want to cook 
omething good what everyone know and enjoy. I'm used to
cooking it in quite simpler way without and carrot, celery
and with ground pork. I also advise you to you pork, becouse in
my opininon ground beef have to strong taste and can be to 
fatty. I once used ground beef, and wasn't happy with the result.
It can be a good idea to mix the ground pork with ground beef
or bacon.

Ingredients:
1 onion 
1 carrot
3-4 garlic cloves

400-500g of ground meat
500g of tomato passata or can of tomatoes + tomato puree
(passata is better)
0,5l of beef stock 
oregano
salt, pepper
4 balls of allspice
2 bay leaves

Grated cheese to serve

1. thinly dice the onion and carrots, slice the garlic. Pour some oil on the Pan
2. Put the onions on the pan on medium for 5 minutes. Afterward, add
garlic and carrots for 10-15 minutes.
3 If your Pan is big enough (It should hold at least 2 liters), put the meat into vegetables. Otherwise, put some oils and vegetables into the bigger pot on medium heat 
and cook the meat on the smaller pan until the meat is not raw.
4. Transfer the meat to vegetables, add tomatoes, 0,5 liter of beef stock, salt, pepper, bay leaves, and allspice. Bring the temperature to high until boiling and then turn it to low.
5. Cook the sauce for about 2 hours, spice it to your tase. 
6. Serve with spaghetti pasta and grated cheese
Enjoy your meal!
