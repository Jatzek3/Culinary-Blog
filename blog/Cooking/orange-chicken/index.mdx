If you hadnt the occasion to eat orange chicken before, You will
be suprised by, how good fried chicken with souce can be.
I found that recipe because in Poland citrus fruits are cheap 
in December. Especially oranges, which are my favorite fruit. Every 
time I go shopping for groceries, I buy a couple of kilograms of oranges.
Once, when I had them stockpiled, I came up with an idea to make some sour dish with them. 

I searched the internet and found a couple of recipes, from which I made the on,e I am presenting to You today.

### Ingredients:

### Chicken:
- 2 chicken breasts, cut in 2cm cubes
- 1 egg, beaten
- 1 cup of flour
- 1 teaspoon of baking soda
- salt
- pepper
- oil,

### Souce:
- 1 cm of ginger, grated
- 2 cloves of garlic, pressed
- 1/2 cup of orange juice
- 5 tablespoons of soy sauce/Maggi
- 1/2 cup of chicken stock 
- 3 tablespoons of sugar
- 1 pepperoncino, grated/1 teaspoon of pepper flakes
- pepper 
- 2 teaspoons of flour

### Method:

1. Pour the oil into deep pan heat it to 180 degrees.
2. On a plate. Mix the flour, baking soda, salt, and pepper. Pieces of 
the chicken dip in the beaten egg and coat in the mixture. Once 
coated fry them until they turn golden/brown.
3. Take a small pot. Mix all ingredients in it, besides the flour. Bring 
it up to boil, then cook on low for 10 minutes.
4. Combine two teaspoons of flour with some water in a small jar. 
Shake it until uniform. Mix it with the sauce while stirring, for a minute.
5. Coat the chicken with sauce. Best served with rice.


### Footnotes:
- Instead of preparing all ingredients by hand, You can mix them in a blender (y)
- You can use oranges and squeeze the juice from them. If you mix it with a blender, you can throw the orange inside {peeled).
- You don't have to deep-fry the chicken. Fry it on the pan, and turn it when begins to brown.
