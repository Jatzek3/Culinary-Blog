So what is Gatsby? Gatsby is a framweork which uses 
React and GraphQL to create static pages prom the data.

This can be very confusing git aeven for people, who know GraphQL
and React so I will try to explain clearer how Gatsby, so it will be
easy to understand even for people who are not close to IT itself

When go on a website, more often than not, there are some simmillar
elements on the website for example a header and footer. Gatsby 
with the help of React give the possibility to create the code once
and then reuse it.

When You have to move from one part of the website, using an internal link,
Gatsby with the help of React allows you to not load all the contents 
once more, and new site appears instanty.

Gatsby with GraphQL allows direct connection with the database, and fetching
only the information needed. You can configure or create backend of 
GraphQl, but if the application small, you can create perfecly working
site without touching to much backend. 

When you want to add a new article to the site, you dont have to 
add the whole structure of element and configure the links to new site.
Gatsby give you the possibility of including simple text and image files by hand
and Gatsby will create them in the way which we specified beforehand.

Beside this, if you are not very close with computers, Gatsby allow to 
use plugins which can give you easy to use Administrative Panel from Wordpress,
or other Content Managment System.
