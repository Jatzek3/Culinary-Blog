### Introduction

Ireland is a long Novel written by Edward Rutherfurd. It spans over 800 sites, divided into 14 chapters. Each chapter describes the lives of members of families in the background of historical events. It is the second part of the Dublin-Ireland Saga. The book is a fine read, especially for those who enjoy history.

Edward Rutherfurd is a pen name, Francis Edward Wintle. He was born in 1948. Graduated from the University of Cambridge, and Stanford Bussiness School. After graduating he worked in political research, bookselling, and publishing. He left his career in 1983 and started writing "Sarum" a historical novel that describes events of over ten thousand years.

Sarum was published in 1987 and became an international best-seller. Remained for 23 weeks on New York Times Bestseller List. After this, he wrote seven more books which became bestselling titles.1

### Description

The main plot revolves around the history of six families:
- The O’Byrnes - ancestors of the High King of Ireland
- The MacGowan's - pre-Celtic craftsmen and merchants
- The Harolds/Doyles - Viking families of farmers and merchants
- The Walshes - Flemish knights settling in Ireland after Strongbow’s Anglo-Norman invasion in the 12th century
- The Tidies - English craftsmen arriving in medieval times
- The Budges - protestant zealots who fight catholicism. 2

Each chapter tells the story of people from different families. To my dislike, the main characters of the chapters are seldom the same, as in previous ones. The author invents new characters which are then placed in one of six family trees. They have some similar traits and are linked with each other by blood. It's convenient for the writer, but not so convenient for the reader.

Fortunately, there are family trees added at the begging of the book, so it is easier to understand kinship. Maps are similarly prepended. The book tells a story about several locations, but the historical events are happening on the whole Irish Iland. Often different lands are mentioned in regards to the Irish insurrections.

The book tells the history of post-medieval Ireland. It was the time under the rule of Protestant England, and more often than not, favored by The King of England. The Irish people were mostly catholic. In the face of sanctions started to convert to Protestant confession.

Irish Insurrections, Oliver Cromwell's invasion, Great Irish Hunger, and I World War. Those are some of the events described. Regrettably, the events are modestly depicted. 

### Summary
    
Ireland is my first book written by Edward Rutherfurd. I borrowed Dublin already, which is the first part of the saga. Even though I read it not in order, the introduction explains a lot. The book is written in very light language, and the events also are depicted in an orderly fashion. That makes the novel very easy and pleasant to read.

Author switly manages family trees. Even one family tree could be difficult to manage easily, not to mention genealogical trees of six families. The author chooses specific and distinct characters to be in the spotlight of each chapter. The characters described in the book are included in the family tree. Simplified genealogical trees are included in the first sites of the book.

There are some clever parts of the novel. It was indeed a treat for me to read these parts. The rest of the book is well-paced and very even. 

There was too little history included. And even in these historical events, the author added much fiction. Often there is one sentence about historical fact, and this is it.

Characters in the book appear mostly in one chapter in person. Then the characters of previous chapters, are mentioned to show kinship and relations. Which creates an impression of a collection of short stories.

Ireland is a prime novel, and I could recommend it to anyone who seeks something educational and fun.
