A "Series of unfortunate events" tells a story about three orphan children. They've inherited a vast fortune and now are under the care of a hostile guardian. The guardian is Count Olaf, which is ready to sacrifice the lives of children to get a hold on their money. 

The series is a sad story of three orphans, which rarely had help in their adventures. Though the series has cartoonish character and this lightens a little bit darkness of the plot. The series shows how helpless can children be when being cared for by the wrong people. How little can other people do, even if they know about children suffering? The theme song words "look away, look away"; A reference, that you
can look away and not be bothered, but you shouldn't. When you see a similar situation in your vicinity, you should act and not look away.
