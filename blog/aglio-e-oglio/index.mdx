If you don't have that much in the fridge and don't want to 
go shopping or order food, spaghetti aglio e oglio is
the dish which can turn your evening into wonder.

I've been making this pasta for a couple of years now, and 
I'm still learning it. With time I become better at it 
and discover new ways of making it. The dish is simple, but timing
is essential, and it can take some practice.

If done right, it's amazing. Here is how I currently make it

Ingredients:
- 75ml olive oil(5 tablespoons)
- 6 cloves of garlic
- 1 peperoncino pepper - grounded  / 1 pinch of hot pepper flakes 
- 200grams of spaghetti pasta
- salt 
- pepper


You should cook pasta and oil simultaneously.
1. Bring a pot of salted water to a boil. Put in pasta.
2. While the pasta is cooking. On the pan, heat the olive oil and 
add finely chopped garlic until it starts to turn golden. (it should take about 6 min)
3. Add pepper, salt, and peperoncino to the pan with garlic. Mix a couple of times. 
Add four spoons of pasta water. 
4. When the pasta is al dente, strain it without pouring any water over it.
(you should check 2-3 times readiness of pasta by tasting it)
5. Take spaghetti pasta and add it to the pan with sauce. Mix it for 2-3 minutes.
6. Add spice and pepper to your taste
7. Voila Bon Appetit





footnotes:
- you can add lemon juice from half of the lemon at the end. 
I tried it today and its great
- You should add finely chopped parsley after you put the 
pasta on the pan with the sauce.
- You should you good quality pasta for this dish.
- You can skip peperoncino if you don't like spicy dishes.
- Don't add cheese. Really don't.
