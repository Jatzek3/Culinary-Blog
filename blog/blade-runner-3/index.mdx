In this review, I wanted to concentrate on three problems which movie 
depicts. 
1. Imagination and romantic relations
2. Identity as an image of ourselves and others.
3. Counciosness and memories

Plot of the movie revolves around main charatchter, and his gainig
insight into who he his. But relevent question which we should ask:
what consituates ourselves as a person? Ridley Scott, movie director,
answer this question that our Identity and memories builds who we 
are, and changes in perspective or giving bigger meanining on some
of our aspects of our lives will change who we are.

From my point of view this thinking is flawed, becouse when people 
expierience trauma, have manic episodes or being manipulated, and 
they perception of reality changes, they don't become other person. 
If this was true, it would be permissive to say that people who are 
angry or sad are not the same people as they are in normal mood. 

The movie concentrates on struggles of main character, and the shift
in his perception. Don't show the fact that, for society,
he is still one and the same person. And this shift from functioning
actor in society with compatible state of mind is acceptable to everyone.
When the Identity of hero changes and his action and ideas are no 
longer in sync with the society, he meets resistance from the circles in which 
he functioned and intrest of the circles to which he aspires.
