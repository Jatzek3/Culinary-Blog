Since Python is only a language, and thanks to learning it intensively before, I felt pretty well
about it. I started to learn Django, in pursuit
of getting a junior backend position.

I created my first own project which summarized,
was summarizing my learning of Python and Django.
It was very hard to deploy, and some backend parts, like
linking mail, working with the database was extremely hard
for me at the time. I succeeded nevertheless, and even though
this project could have more functionalities, I was and am
very proud of It.

Next, I started to mentor pro bono some people in python on 
Facebook, looking for some freelancing gigs and applying for jobs.
I did found a client but didn't feel competent enough to work with him. I also gave some short advice for some beginners in
Python.

In this time I also started to learn about Computer Science from
MIT lectures on youtube, and Software Engineering from different sources
PyCon lectures, sites, and lectures about specific topics.
