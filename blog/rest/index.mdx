Did you ever wonder how and where the websites get
the information to show them on the screen? There is a standard
widely adopted on the internet how frontend applications should send questions and receive answers, and it is named REST. The rest of the article
is a little bit more technical.

REST stands for representational state transfer and is a standard created so programmers can have a common, understandable way of creating applications.
REST is not a part of the HTTP protocol, it is just a way of
using this protocol, and the most often used HTTP methods in REST are GET, POST, PUT, DELETE.
They correspond to CRUD (create, read, update, delete), the most common functions in applications.
RESTful web services can use YAML, XML, JSON, or other formats to transmit data,
but JSON is today's standard. 

Architectural guidelines:

1. Client-server architecture - stating that application should be split into client-side and server-side. 
Thanks to this, it's not necessary to change the application on the server-side to ensure the functioning of the application on many different browsers. This rule  enables easy scalability on the server-side, and allow to develop
application separately. 

2. Statelessness - All queries from the client-side, can be computed separately from previous
requests. 

3. Cacheability - Thanks to cached responses, it is possible to take some load of the server.

4. Layered system - The server can have proxies or load balancers to improve performance and security.

5. Code on demand - Servers can transfer executable code to the client, such as client-side scripts as
JavaScript.

6. Uniform interface - fundamental for any RESTful system four constraints
- Resource identification in requests - Individual resources are identified in the request, for example in URLs in RESTful web services. Resources are separate from the response sent to the client.
For example, the server sends a response in JSON, but data is stored in an SQL database.
- Resource manipulation through representation - if a client holds the representation of resources it has,
enough information to modify or delete the resource's state
- Self-descriptive messages - Each message includes enough information to describe how to process the message.
- Hypermedia as the engine of application state  - A user of the web should have the possibility 
to access all of the contents of the web page by using hyperlinks.
