Nazwa nawiązuje do funny games, Jako że knock knock jest zabawą

- Karą nie była śmierć tylko udostępnienia wideo na facebooku. Widać było komentarze ganiące zachowanie Keanu Reevesa. Jednocześnie dziewczyny powiedziały, że każdy ulega.

1. Introduction
 - Actors - Keanu reeves +++, Lorenza Izzo +, Anna de Armas(at the start of her career) ++
 - Director - Eli Roth, helping tarantino in directing and as actor(Donny Donnovitz) on Inglorious bastards. Directed some slashers(Hostel, Hostel 2, Cabin Fever) in his carrer
 - Inspired evidently with Funny Games
 - It's is worth watchinh aspecially If you watched Funny games. I think its better than funny games and more (wykończony),  but funny games was created at first and created the convention for this movie. A lot of more creative work was put in the 1997 version of Funny Games
 2. The movie starts, simmilarly like in funny games with family scene, where Keanu Reeves speeks about himself in third person as the "Monster".
 (Introduction of Wife, two kids, coworkek and a dog in the movie)
This is followed with loud rock music. This time we know the source of the music. Father - Keanu Reeves listens to it, while drinking wine and smoking marijuana(?) when no one is watching.
 - Knocking on the doors interupts him. Two young girls in wet clothes are standing at the front door. 
 - this time direcoctor got right "invitation to house" scene so it lasts for some time(unlike in Funny Games)
 3. The story moves on from this time, while girl starting to be more flirty and crossing the fathers personal boundaries. As in Funny games there was violence involved, here is sex. Father resists, but the girls persistently drag him into her game.


 4. Why does the stupid girl stereotype suposse to turn on men? Why does seduction in culture often inloves expensive thigs, and distingiushed taste, class.
 Why this opposites exists.
 Maybe these are the games people play even though they know its fake?
 Or maybe they dont know that the (fake) signs of status in don't create antyhing lasting , and want to impress people?
 5. In movie we can see a difference in behaviour when someone is in power(is he really? he resits, though girls persist in the game), and when he is helples. 
 6. Hero is on one side sophisticated caring father, and the "monster, which i showing when Father(evan) shows his basics intincs. This could be the goal of the game for girls to let get mad.
 7.  Girls devastate the works of his wife? A commentary on Modern Art? Is it a methaphore for destroing family by unfaithfull father? a comentary on arbitrality on modern art? Or just simple demostration of violence and power over Evans family?
 8. Eventually "Monter" speaks, when girls tell him what punishment will be given to him. And though the punishment is very severe Evan would rather take it then what will be instead given.
 9. Funny games came out in 1997 and 2007, social media wasn't really a thing. Eventually it shows which life is more meanigfull for Evan, the one he try to show for others, or the actual life. It's indeed interesting that banishment after Two millenia became the most sever punishent.
 10. There are a ton of simmilarities beetween both movies. And also lots of way of interpretation. If youre not interested in comparing the movies, and want to just enjoyably spend the evening, then there are Beutifll actresses, Keanu Reeves and a lots of action.
