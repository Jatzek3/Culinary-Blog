Racial inequalities in the US are quite a popular topic of cinema nowadays.
Even if it is not the main thread of movie plot, directors and screenwriters 
like to redeem movie history from the wrongdoings of past directors 
and eagerly, sometimes very awkwardly put some black-skinned characters into the movie
or give them more screen time.

That's is not the case in 96 minutes, a movie that portrays four characters
with different social backgrounds and ethnicity. The beginning of 
the film depicts two worlds, first the world of black people, living in poverty
ruled by gangs, oppressed and stigmatized, and second the world of white people
from private schools, and living a peaceful life, protected by the police.

These two worlds collide with each other when four main characters meet, in very
unfavorable circumstances.

I think It is a worthwhile movie. The scenes are sometimes very naive and 
shows, very bluntly social injustice, but the plot is convincing.
