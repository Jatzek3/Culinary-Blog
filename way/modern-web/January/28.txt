Today I've read next chapter of JavaScript Guide. Chapter 15: Scripting Documents.
Many informations was outdated, but there was some usefull ones:
 	about DOM manipulation
	NodeList Arrays
	specific infprmation about QuerySelectors
The author wrote, that this chapter is possibly most important in the book. And
I agree that understanding DOM, element hierarchy and communication beetweem the browser
client is very important. Nowadays we have modern frontend frameworks, and we dont have to
know about unused features of HTML.(aspecially <frame> and <iframe> elemnts).
