In this review, I wanted to concentrate on three problems which movie 
depicts. 
1. Imagination and romantic relations
2. Identity as an image of ourselves and others.
3. Counciosness and memories

The plot of the movie revolves around the main character and his gaining
insight into who He is. But the relevant question which we should ask:
what constitutes ourselves as a person? Ridley Scott, movie director,
answers this question that our identity and memories build who we are, and changes in perspective or giving bigger meaning on some
of the aspects of our lives will change who we are.

From my point of view, this thinking is flawed, because when people 
experience trauma, have manic episodes or being manipulated, and 
the perception of reality changes, they don't become other people. 
If this was true, it would be permissive to say that people who are 
angry or sad is not the same people as they are in a normal mood. 

The movie concentrates on the struggles of the main character and the shift
in his perception. Don't show the fact that, for society,
he is still the same person. And this shift from functioning
actors in society with a compatible state of mind is acceptable to everyone.
When the identity of the hero changes and his action and ideas are no longer in sync with society, he meets resistance from the circles in which he functioned and the interest of the circles to which he aspires.
