World:
- You can choose comfortable timeline in the nearest future, so the world would be slightly
diffetent from current
- You don't have to be historically accurate - the new wold began on day of the 
apocalypse, no need to refer to historical facts.
- You can place the action on very diferent sets of terrain, since many helicopters 
planes were abadoned
- A place to create one/many economies or religions(like bottlecaps in Fallout).

When creating main characters for your story, you arent tied to few choices.
Zombie apocalypse gives you the oportunity to choose from any person in the whole world.
You choose who are your heroes of the story, and the avarage social barriers do not apply.
In the group you can have owner of the biggest screw factory, an engeneer working for the 
competition and worker which is also active member of labour union. They all can be in 
the same company, and have no reason to argue since the apocalypse change the traditional 
social hierarchy. Now charismatic worker which is also very handy can be the leader of the group.
While owner, could be a slave which just hope to get food next day.

Most specialized proffessions loses its meaning in posta-apocalyptic world. Old blue collar
jobs gain on value. Even if job isn't usefull daily, the strength gives advantage to 
people who worked with hands. Doctors would be in high demand, and there could be wars beetween the clans for 
the possesion of one. New proffession could evolve, or been revived from the past.
 
It is very easy to add new heroes ass plot develops. Whole world is full of survivors, and 
surviving groups. You can make allience with another group. Trade or exchange for member of 
your opponent team. There is really no limitation, on how and whith what kind of members, your 
group of heroes will expand.

- You can refer too other movie genres like, horror, western,sci-fi (the easiest)
- You can create very strange locations, becouse of many different resources was left
	some engeneeries/musueam curators could construct exciting places
