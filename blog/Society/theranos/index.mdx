"Asking yourself wheter you're wrong is a really
good thing... If you really feel strong convivtion
that You're doing the right thing, then keep going."
Elizabeth Holmes.
Founder & Former CEO, Theranos

Elizabeth Holmes, decided to drop out of Stanford at age of 19, to
develop health solutions in silicon valley. She wanted to create
a machine that would make blood tests. This machine would be the size
of pc printer, and the blood would be taken from the finger and would
be close to a drop of blood.

Thanks to her connections she quickly gathered in her company group 
of very high profile people which had rarely any knowledge of chemistry,
biology or health industry:<br/> 
- Henry Kissinger (former US Secretary of State)<br/> 
- George Shultz (former US Secretary of State)<br/> 
- William Perry (former Secretary of Defense) <br/> 
- James Mattis (former Secretary of Defense)<br/> 

So according to the popular pop psychology saying "fake it till you make it",
Elizabeth Holmes could go on for years without alarming the investors.

Elizabeth Holmes got also has many traits which many Silicon Valley
wonder people got. She was charismatic, driven, and had a technological dream.
Also similar to Steve Jobs, Mark Zuckerberg and Bill Gates was a drop
out from prestigious universities. She was also trying to mimic the moves
of Steve Jobs, wear similar clothes like him, and was inspired by him.
Above all that was a young female, which found many backers in the IT world,
and sexual diversity is very promoted in this field. Young Elizabeth, which was
a self-made billionaire before 30 was attracting all attention instead of her product.

Introducing Theranos machine, to be publicly available for people in Wallgreens
Grocery Shop, was a big thing that grounded the credibility in the machine.
In reality, the machine only did a couple of tests, and the rest was made with 
Siemmens machines which required a bigger amount of blood taken from the vein.

Still, for a big amount of time and non-disclosure agreements and trickery of the CEO to the board, the truth about the not working Edison machine, could
remain hidden. In truth, I believe that from the start Elizabeth Holmes believed
that it will be possible to achieve the goal, and she justified her lies to make it work, eventually. But once the scale of the company was too big, there was no way for her to back out and admit to mistake, so she kept her story going.

The story of Elizabeth Holmes can lead to many conclusions, which don't show 
condition of man, and so "enlightened" leaders of technological innovations in 
the best way.
