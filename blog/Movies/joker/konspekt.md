### Introduction


### "I hope my death will make more cents than my life"

He felt better in mental clinic than in society. 

He can relate to kids, but when it comes to adult relations he have problems which he rresolves with compulsive laughter. But you can doubt that is real, and It could be a way to get out of troublesome social situations. When find other people who acts spontaneusly he can easily relate to them.

Fantasize about his role model Murray, Who is a father figure for Arthur. "The Lights, The show, the audience, all that stuff, I would give up in a hartbeat to have a kid like You" - Murray says to him in his fantasies. We can see that he don't have a typical border of whats real and whats is his imagination. His beliefs are sometime more real for him then reality.

Loose his social services support, and get to know, that high up in society noone care about the simple people.

-
First appearence on stage interrupted though with his compulsive loughter. Get him in great mood, and he feels appriciated.

He sees that his murders grant him the time in the media, the imaginary worl in which Arthur lived in.

### "I though my Life was a tragedy, but now I realized It's a comedy"

-
Wayne calls him a coward - the begging of relationship.
From his mothers letter to him he thinks he is the son of Thomas wyane.
He meets Bruce wayne and give put on a happy face to him

Thomas Wayne antihero - his dellusions desyoed once again
-

Muraay welcomes him to show - to presumably make laugh of him
-

-

He stops agrreing to social rules, and steals his mother files - and its positive for him. He learns that his mother was treating him very rough.

-
He accept his laughter, and dont repress it, as before when he obeyed social rules it was compulsive. Now he identifies with it and dont look back on what people say, feel relieved. And for the first time he feels happy when he suffocates his mother(symbol of suffering and social rules) with a pillow ;).

-
### "My life is nothing but a comedy"

This is a period, when Arthur develops philosophy to fight back against the unjust oppersion and social system. He takes revenge on people who harmed him, and arbitraryly punish people who took advantage of him.

Arthur accepts his joker authenthic personality and is truly happy. As a new person don't have any romorse to kill bullies or people who oppress the weak.
Everytime he kills he feel relieved.

Policemen in the subway are a symbol of the oppression.

Joker becomes his true self just before entering the Scene o Murray show.

"Comedy is subjective muray. Isnt is that what they say"
"All of you decide what right or wrong, the same way. Whats funny or not"
"Why all these people are upset about these guys(...) If it was me dyning on the sidewalk you would pass over me"

"What do you get, when you cross a loner, with a mentall illenss when society abodened him"
"You get what you, f.....g, deserve"

"To all people that have been ignored by society..." (in the radio) - after killing murray

### Couple of happy Thoughts



### Symbolism

1. Id, Ego, SuperEgo - Joker starts to be himself when he abandon social rules, and starts acting how "he want and feel about people"

1. Wayne is the face of the rotting social system, hypocrisy.

8. Murrays show always on when on his mother is present - represatation of father figure

2. His mother represents, self control and obeying the rules of society. She was a person closest to him, but lied and made him suffer. She represent the hipocricy and the harm which social rules couse to the disabled and poor people.

9. Rats, and facade social rules symbolizes the sickness in which the society is functioning. When joker goes on the killing spree, the social rules are thrown out and the riots opposing the social hierarchy start to rise.

0. Stairs he climb heavilly upwards in the begiing of the movie, and as a Joker he dances down from them happily as he could ever be

9. television, shows and acting represent the imaginary world in he exist the more insane he gets. And in this world everthing is exagerated and don't have to obey to social rules.

### Everything happens in his head

10. He was locked before in hospital (why you were locked before in hospital)
 (theory) It all happens in jokers head in hospital - scene with social worker (which should be psychiatrist to prescribe him drugs) in the begging of a movie + his shown in hospital 9in this scene. Do you know why you was locked in the hospital
    - ending scene with psychiatrist (also black woman and mental hospital)
    - Television gives him material to tell the story of his life in his head - thomas wayne/murders/murray'
    - his neighbouring exist mainly in his head.
    - he has to many bullets for a 6shoot revolver to make all the killings
    - hospital allways appears when he meets with psychiatrist(social-worker(on the id) psychiatrist).
    - (for my whole life i didnt knew a really existed, but I do - joker?)

### Thomas Wayne is really Arthur Fleck Father

11. (theory) Thomas wayne is really jokers father. Penny was working for him, she was atractive woman which with her son was moleteted by partner of Penn(Thomas Wayne - black characketr). Penny tells Artur that they mad her sign some papers (adoption papers so there wouldnt be scandal of bastard son)
- Arthur Has a young Penny photo signed - "Love your smile T. W." - When he is doing making make up for Muray Show. And and he throw it to trash (after killing her)
- As Penny writes to Tomhas Wayn she tought artur to respond happily to negative situation. She trained Arthur to act happily in stresfull and upleasant situations.

### Comedy is subjective murrray - differnet ways to make people laugh

12. Different sources of goiving laughter to people
    - being a victim of violence
    - being an object of joke to laugh - from murray
    - being a clown - from making a fool of yourself
    - being a standuper/ comedian - when people laugh from your jokes - Arthur want to be in this role but he is constnly trated as a victim.
    - So he becomes a Joker - who create subjective comedy where he is the person with power.

### A movie about attention

Arthur lacks attention this movie is all about this abadonment of people mentally ill. Instead of caring people make fun of and osticize people who need attention
- Thomas wayne - "maybe a little attention, maybe a hug dad", "shes crazy"
- Murray - when he make laugh of him and invite him to his show
- Social Worker - when she doesent pay attention, and says that society abandoened him
- His mother - never pays attention to him, and doesen't know that "he never felt happy in his life"
- his co worker - when he gives him gun.

Arthur feel really good when, he can make people laugh, and notice him.
- In murray show - "what happens when you cross..."
- In the stand up show
- when he fantasize about his neighbour
- at the end of the movie when he dances on the top of the mask of a car.
