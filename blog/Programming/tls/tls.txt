### Intoduction
Transport Layer Security is a cryptographic protocol created to give internet communication security. We most often can see Transport Layer Security in action
in HTTPS, but it also used in other communication application

	A cryptographic protocol is an abstract or concrete protocol that performs a security-related function and applies cryptographic methods, often as sequences of cryptographic primitives. A protocol describes how the algorithms should be used and includes details about data structures and representations, 
	at which point it can be used to implement multiple, interoperable versions of a program.[1]

The server sets up a connection with TLS usually on port 443. Unprotected communication most often is set on port 80.
After the client end server agrees to use TLS, they negotiate the connection.
-asymmetric cipher to set a shared key for a symmetric cipher
- setting details of the connection

TLS doesn't fit very well in the OSI model of connection layers. It servers encryption, which means that is assigned to the presentation layer.

### History

#### Secure Data Network System

Works on TLS together with other security basic security platforms began in August 1986. National Security Agency started to work on securing communication on the next-generation computer network. Originally known as the SP4 protocol, it was renamed TLS in 1995.


#### SSL 1.0, 2.0, and 3.0

SSL was developed in Netscape. Taher Elgamal,  chief scientist at Netscape Communications from 1995 to 1998, has been described as the "father of SSL".
SSL 1.0 was never publicly released. Version 2.0 had many flaws, due to which it didn't function very well and didn't provide complete security. It was declared obsolete in 2011.
In 1996 draft of SSL 3.0 was published. New versions of SSL/TLS are based on SSL 3.0, which was deprecated in June 2015.

### TLS 1.0, TLS 1.1

TLS was created in January 1999 as an upgrade to SSL Version 3.0. Creators stated, "the differences between this protocol and SSL 3.0 are not dramatic, but they are significant enough to preclude interoperability between TLS 1.0 and SSL 3.0". The biggest IT companies declared TLS 1.0 deprecated in march 2020.
Even though TLS 1.1 introduced a couple of improvements to the protocol, it was widely deprecated about the same time as TLS 1.0

#### TLS 1.2 and 1.3


TLS 1.2 was defined in August 2008
- TLS version 1.2 removed compatibility with SSL 2.0. TLS sessions never negotiate the use of Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) version 2.0. 
- It introduced many encryption changes, improving the security of the connection
- Simplified handshake
- possibility to specify for client and server which algorithms they accept 

TLS 1.3 was defined in August 2018. It introduced many changes but still is not widely adopted.
