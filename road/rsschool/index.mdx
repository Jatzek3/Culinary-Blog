When I was ending my work on Django project Reviews
I started to learn HTML and CSS to add styles to the application. 
And since JavaScript was also the language of the web, I learned the basics of it.

With knowledge from 4 "Head First Books" quite good
proficiency in Python and latest learning of Computer Science
I enrolled in RS school and benefited from the great help of my mentor.

The Program of the school is very hard. It makes you learn topics, by solving mind-bending tasks. The CSS and 
HTML tasks were difficult because these were my very first contacts 
with these technologies. Through the big amount of work, I could solve them and learned to work with them by heart 
(including CSS grid and flexbox)

The JavaScript part was hard, but I knew Python, and learning a new language shouldn't be that hard. I spent some time-solving tasks,
reading "Modern JavaScript Tutorial",  "JavaScript The Good Parts" and very often worked with documentation

Learning React, for the final task, was also a big thing. I didn't have
any contact with this framework till this time. But thankfully maxed out 
in points the "Chat" application(100/100) and exit interview about React-Redux(96/100) 

I finished as 10th of over 200, which I consider a personal success.

### Skills Acquired:
- JavaScript
- Semantic HTML
- CSS(Grid, Flexbox) 
- Frontend Testing
- React & Redux
- WebSockets
