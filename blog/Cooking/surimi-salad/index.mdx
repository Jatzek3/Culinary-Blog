### Servings: 6

I was searching for a recipe which would be good with surimi. I didn't 
have all the ingredients for the chosen one. I managed to replace some 
of them and combine them. The effect was amazing, and I present it 
to you below. 


### Ingredients:

- 250g of crab sticks
- a cup(250ml) of rice
- a can (400g) of corn
- a can (400g) of peas
- half of the medium-sized onion, finely diced
- a cup(250g) of sour cream 18%

### Spices:

- salt,
- pepper,
- one tablespoon (15ml) of soy sauce or Maggi

### Method:

1. Cook the rice at least an hour later so it won't be hot.
2. Cut the crab sticks into 1-2cm pieces. 
3. Add crab sticks, drained peas and corn to rice.
4. Add sour sourcream and spices. 
5. Add spices according to your taste. Mix the salad.

Smacznego


### Footnotes
- You can replace sour cream with mayonnaise. Just not that much.
