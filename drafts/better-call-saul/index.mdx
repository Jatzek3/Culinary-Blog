### Introduction

Better Call Saul is a prequel to critically and publicly acclaimed Breaking Bad. It is at least as good as Breaking Bad, and I recommend it to everyone. It is six seasons long, and Bob Odenkirk does a great job playing his character. I doubt if the series would even take place, if it wasn't for Odenkirk's role. 
There are some actors from the original series, who played their roles well. They play mostly supporting roles. Two important new appearances are Kim Wexler(Rhea Seehorn), who companies Jimmy throughout the series, and Chuck McGill(Micheal McKean) Jimmy's Brother. You cant tell a bad word about them, but Chuck's role was more difficult.

### The world and time.

The action of the series takes place before the events of Breaking Bad. In the Southern US city of Albuquerque, the largest city in New Mexico. It provides a lot of place for big and small legal cases. Both are within the scope of the Better Call Saul. What connects the story to Breaking Bad is Jimmy's connection to a drug cartel, which he involuntarily gets pulled in. 

The plot revolves around Jimmy McGill. He is an aspiring attorney, and can't get his career started. In the meantime, he is also taking care of his mentally ill brother. It's hard for him to make ends meet. He was making good money while making pranks and hustling people for money. He even got his pseudonym bach in the days  "Slipping Jimmy".

### Interpratation.

One of the main threads of the plot is presenting that regular people don't have the access to the upper class. Ordinary people from the start are forbidden entrance to prestigious colleges, universities, and scholarships. This is represented by the fight Jimmy had with His brother Chuck. Chuck. Chuck was an owner of his company HHM and restricted Jimmy the right to work there as a lawyer. Even when Jimmy had his law degree. The rest of the board agreed he could work as a partner. Chuck denied him this possibility, because he knew about Jimmy's past, and fought that the law is above "Slippin Jimmy".

Chuck was in a sens book smart. Diligent and precise lawyer. He's been getting appraisals, from the top of his field. While he was a good lawyer, he wasn't even close to being "street smart" as Jimmy.

Jimmy, on the other hand, had an entrepreneurial character. When it comes to understanding people, and people's needs, he is a person you want to hire. He's laud, colorful and convincing. The opposite of his brother. While Chuck will see for the proper regulation to overcome the obstacle. Jimmy will find the fastest way possible.

Finally, there is the third person. A woman who studied hard and worked her way up the to the attorney bar. Kim Wexler accompanies Jimmy in the whole series. At some point, she finds out, that everybody should have the right to a good attorney, not just people who can afford it.

### Summary

If Better Call Saul isn't worth watching there's no other show worth it. It's a straightforward show with some depth and possible interpretation. Be aware that If you would like to intellectualize, you will most likely have to make things up or dwell on things that aren't there. It's a great show, and It accurately shows the director's point of view. There are times when you could be torn in the judgment of the characters. But there aren't that many. And thanks to this Better Call Saul is such a terrific series. It doesn't have to be anything more or anything less.
