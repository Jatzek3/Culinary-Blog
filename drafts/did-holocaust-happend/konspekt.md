1. Introduction
    - the preciseness oh historical knowledge - what happend, what is propaganda
    - Can such a global event could be falsify to happen?

2. Arguments 
    - Why would Germany make holocaust?
        - bad reputation on the world
        - the administrative cost of creating such facilities
        - killing actual cheap labour to work in work camps
        - exterminating many skilled workers, lawyers doctors, proffesors
        + only the ideological side seem to speak for the holocaust
    - How the holocaust was suposedly commenced
        - Gas trucks
        - Gas chambers
        - disposing of bodies
            - crematories
            - mass graves
    - The facts
        - There where work camps for not jewish population -1,6mln notj Jewish people was regitered there, 800 thousand died
        - Cyklon B was german insectised which should be often used in simmmilar poor conditions
        - Crematories in big work camps seems reasonble since from famine, and poor living condition many people died there
        - There are no actual Nazi documents which indicates on organizing the holocaust.
    - What could happen to Jews if not shoah
        - Jews needn't to be exterminated to dissapear:\
        - they could escape from 3 reich
        - take the Identity of polish neighbours
        - They could have take new ID(as in Schindlers list)
        - They could migrate to created post-war Isreal, 
        - they could hide and survive as shown in pianist.
        - They could survive nazi work camps, as free workers.
        - Get to the polish guerilla
         And I think there are many more ways to survive which I just don't know
    - Why faking holocaust could be beneficial for The Allies
        - colaboration between Stalin and Roosvelt after Hitler took France in 1940
        - Even though Comunism can be seen as opponent for USA today, FDR preffered Stalin to Hitler.
        - Stalin quickly became huge threat for USA, and propaganda explaining why USA choose Stalin over Hitler could be very handy. If not for the holocoust USA potenctially could creates most deadly enemy, and help to get rid of it biggest opponent.
