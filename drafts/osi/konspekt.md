Introduction

During my shortlife I got involved in couple of activieties you could call addictive. Alcohol, nicotine, coffeine, computer games, hazard, sex, drugs and also other thing we can perceive through the lens of dopendecies like personal relation, self-image, ideologies etc. This all things have good and bad sides like all things. I struggled very much to unerstand what the addiction is. Until I understand one thing. If any single "good like love" or "bad like drugs" thing take most of your time and attention, and disturbs your other parts of life its most certainly is an addciton.

The books and addictions

Recently I borrowed a book from the library "Uzależnienia: geneza, terapia, powrót do zdrowia" (Addictions: genesis, therapy, recovery). It is very interesting book, with many tales agedodetes and interesting facts. Unfortunately it didn't resolve my question, which I am asking myslef what does it mean to be addicted. And any numeber of knowledge, won't be able to understand it if you are not addicted. On the other hand people with addictions often want to prove their control over the substance or other stuff.

There are very numerous scales, questionaries which help you determine if you are addicted or not. It's definately not a usefool diagnostic tool. Even if you will get a professional diagnosis it doesent mean that you are addicted or not. The only peson, who can reliable give you diagnosis is you, and your sincerity with yourself. AA meetings are very helpfull with this. In Poland there are AA meetings, where you can go and like you are at home with your addiction or simmillar. I felt well but also it give me to much I what I allready had, and thus it was fueling my using of substance.

I lack personal relations and I have very much time. I can use this time to grow, have fun, develop my intrests. But there is  little people in my life, and I would sacrafice much to be the otherway. Alcohol can sometimes fill this void. 

I smoked before for 15 years, and wasnt addicted. I liked to do it. I like it still now, but I'm smoking much less cigarettes(once a month I buy a pack). I played online games and they took some share of my time. I sometimes fell like it was addictions, simmirarly to playing online poker. But it still wasn't an addiction. Im addicted to writing on chat and love. It is difficult to imagine my life without it, and I can say It's an addiction. I do it dialy, fantasize about it and think about it all the time.

Summmary
