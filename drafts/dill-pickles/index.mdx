Ogórki Kiszone is a staple polish side dish. It is served as a side dish, on sandwiches, in sauces, and at parties as a healthy addition to 40% alcohol beverage.

It is a second pickled dish that I learned to make. The first was Korean Kim-Chi. Which is pickled cabbage with a paste of hot paprika. It is a tasty traditional Korean dish, but I doubt everyone will enjoy its specific taste and smell. I recommend you to give it a try in a restaurant or make it by yourself. 

As with Kimchi, I also got quickly hooked on pickling cucumbers. You can pickle everything, though some vegetables are more suitable for it than others. Now, for example, I added tomatoes to the cucumber. I will have a mix of tomatoes and cucumbers.

### Ingredients:

- 4x 1litre jars
- 2kg of ground cucumbers - best are small ones. They are better in taste and are easier to fit in the jars
- 4 tablespoons of salt 
- 4 liters of water 
- 1 head of garlic garlic
- a bunch of mature dills

You can add: 
- seeds of charlock
- seeds of cilantro
- little hot peppers
- oak or blackcurrant or cherry leaves

### Method:
1. Scald out the jars and jar lids.
2. Put the garlic, dill, and other additives evenly in all the jars.
3. Fill the jars with washed cucumbers. First place the largest, then fill the jars with smaller ones.
4. Boil the water and add the salt. Four big tablespoons of salt. 
5. While the water is still very hot, pour it with a ladle into the jars.
6. Screw the lid on, and leave it at room temperature for three days.
7. After three days, move the jars to the cellar or fridge for the next two weeks.
8. The cucumbers are ready. You can keep them in the cellar for the whole year.


### Footnotes:
- You can speed the process, by keeping it at room temperature for longer than three days. It's not recommended, since cucumbers won't be as good as the original.
