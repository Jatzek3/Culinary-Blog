I was surprised by the simplicity and delicious taste of this Portuguese dish. After the first time, you have done it
you will want to have it from time to time.

The dish doesn't look like a restaurant-quality dish but is very tasty
and you will be happy that you stumbled upon this recipe.

You will need a deep/big pan.

Ingredients:
- 400g cod fillet, split into small pieces
- 500g potatoes, cut into thin strips 
- 1 onion, finely diced
- 1 bulb of garlic, finely sliced                                                                                                       
- 6 eggs
- olive oil 
- oil
- salt
- pepper
- 100g of black olives

Method:
1. Pour some oil into the pan and fry the potatoes on high heat.
2. Once the potatoes are ready, pull them off the pan and place them on a
plate with a paper towel.
3. Pour some olive oil on the pan set to high, and when hot, turn 
the heat to medium. Brown onion and garlic. Add the cod and stir from time to time until the fish is white.
4. When the fish is ready, add potatoes and stir for a minute. Afterward
add salt and pepper. Take the pan off the heat. Take the eggs and mix them with a fork in a separate bowl.
5. Pour the eggs on the fish and potatoes. Place it back on the medium heat and 
stir it constantly until the eggs set.
6. Decorate the dish with black olives. Serve with bread.

Footnotes:
- In the original recipe, I've read to add pepper and salt to the egg mixture.
Don't do this because pieces of pepper will clump together. Even if you are making 
scrambled eggs, add pepper (if you need to, because in my opinion it's used too often) when eggs won't be 
runny on the pan.
-The dish doesn't look very appetizing, even if you'll add black olives and some fresh herbs. They 
will cover some of it, but I would advise you to skip the decorations and don't serve
bacalhau a bras to your guests. Make it for you familly or some really close friends.
