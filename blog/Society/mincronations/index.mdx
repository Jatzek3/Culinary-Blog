Have You ever dreamed of becoming a president or a king?
I will tell you about how easy it is to become one. Many people
in the world fulfilled their ambition to become the head of the state.

Some time ago, I've come up with the idea of creating a virtual nation. Citizenship would be granted upon registration. There would be no initial laws, and the code 
of the website would be open source. The state would be governed by polls in which 
all citizens could cast a vote. Laws and government also would be decided this way.
Having this in mind I wanted to check if there are existing communities or nations.

After the search, I came up with some conclusions.
1. The internet communities play a similar role.
2. There are many micronations with the state already formed.
3. There is a micronation, which fulfills the role I have In mind for my nation 
(Wirtland - even appeared on some public media) 

If you want to become a prince, president, or overlord, all you have to 
do is create your own country. Not always, custom, small countries, 
have serious attitude to their sovereignty. Many micronations 
inspired by fantasy. Some have more down-to-earth relations with their reign 
and treat their leaving room as territory and parents as international partner countries.

There are a plethora of different micronations, and I encourage you to search some 
more on the topic on your own. I will write about two of the most intriguing micronations,
in my opinion.
- Rose island
- Sealand
