Spaghetti Carbonara is a  simple dish, which can be made at the time pasta is cooking. It is hard to believe that a simple recipe can produce such a fine dish.
I won't be using original Italian ingredients, since they are expensive, and 
the pasta from the recipe is delicious.

### Ingredients:

- 2 eggs
- 50g of cheese
- 100g of bacon or sausage
- 250g of spaghetti pasta

### Spices:

- salt
- pepper
- 1teaspoon of Maggi/soy sauce


### Method:

1. On the pan, put your diced meat and fry it for a couple of minutes
2. Boil the water in the pot. Add pasta and cook until it's al dente
3. In the meantime mix: very thinly grated cheese, two raw eggs,
one pinch of salt, Maggi/soy sauce, and two pinches of pepper.
4. Stir the egg mixture, until it will have a uniform consistency.
5. When your pasta is ready, strain it and quite quickly get it back into
the pot. Take the egg mixture and pour it into the pasta. While you are stirring it intensively, for about 2 minutes. Till whole pasta is coated in the sauce. If you won't execute this step properly, your dish will become scrambled eggs with spaghetti.
6. Add the meat from the pan and stir it a little bit more.

### Footnotes

- Some people add cream to the recipe. I think this is inappropriate
because the dish has a creamy taste on its own.
- I read on the internet a recipe that added garlic. I wouldn't do that.
- If you have mushrooms, you can add them sliced to the meat. It is 
good combinations  
- Original Italian recipe uses egg yolks. I prefer whole eggs.
