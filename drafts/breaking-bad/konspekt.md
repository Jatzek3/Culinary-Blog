- Heroes are not black and white they character develop over time, they morali background is often questioned by their choices
- Two people exist in normal life and strugles, and have other life as drug lords and have to play their roles. (Iceberg - 20% on top - 80% below the surface)
- supporting actors their roles orbits around main characters
- unlike the "Better Call Saul" the story of two main characters is interwoven. Even though Walt tries to keep Jesse out of his life he ie Bound to him. Jesse Adresses Walt by his name "You need me more then I need You. Walt", as he would usually end the prhrease with the word "Biatch"

- Simmilar developing of the Charachter of Skyler as with the (lawyer woman in Better Call Saul.). From Supporting actor to main role. 
-Skylar, habits are used in the drug bussiness, and are used in it. Her morality changes but her character doesent. Unlike Walt which morality and habits, undergo heavy (stopniowÄ…) transformation
- Two faces of Walt. Walt says sorry twice for involving his exlover Gretchen from Gray Matter (sponsoring his cqancer treatment), but when the discussion changes sides and she says "sorry" - he says "fuck you" For something long in the past.
- Two faces of Jesse. A lowlife drug addict, but take care of poor children, give people second chances
