"- Knock, knock. 
 - Whos there?
 - It's the police maam. Your son have been hit by a drunk driver. His dead.
 - No, no, no. You can't joke about that[...].
 - You decide whats right or wrong. The same way you decide whats funny or not"


### Introduction


### "I hope my death will make more cents than my life"

Arthur Fleck works as clown. He is sad person who obey social rules, dresses as clown and acts as a happpy person but indeed he is suffering. He felt better in mental clinic than in society. 

He can relate to kids, but when it comes to adult relations he have problems which he rresolves with compulsive laughter. But you can doubt that his laugh is authenthintic, and It could be a way to get out of troublesome social situations. 

Arthur Fantasize about his role model Murray, Who is a father figure for him. "The Lights, The show, the audience, all that stuff, I would give up in a hartbeat to have a kid like You" - Murray says to him in his fantasies. We can see that he don't have a typical border of whats real and whats is his imagination. His beliefs are sometime more real for him then the reality.

Hero experiences couple of severe tramatic events in short time.


### "People expect you to behave as if you D@NT"

Arthur craetes an imaginary relationship with one of his neighbour, when she shows him a litle attention.

Kills 3 jocks that are bullying young women in the subway. Then He dances with cleansing calm music in background. Experiences tranquility. He see that his murders grant him the time in the media, and attention he strived for.

Loose his social services support, and get to know, that in higher class no one care about the simple people.

At his first appearence on stage, though interrupted, with his compulsive loughter, gets him in great mood, and he feels appriciated.


### "I though my Life was a tragedy, but now I realized It's a comedy"

Arthur learns from his mothers letter to him he thinks he is the son of Thomas Wyane. Decide to go to Wayne residence, where he meets young Bruce wayne, whoi later will become Batman, and give put on a happy face on him.

Murray shows his performing tape on his show and make fun of him. Muraay welcomes him to show - to presumably make laugh of him.

Visits his neighbour, which dont recognise him, and his only positive relation appear to be delusions

### "My life is nothing but a comedy"

This is a period, when Arthur develops philosophy to fight back against the unjust oppersion and social system. He takes revenge on people who harmed him, and arbitraryly punish people who took or trying to take advantage of him.

Arthur accepts his joker authenthic personality and is truly happy. As a new person don't have any romorse to kill bullies or people who oppress the weak. Everytime he kills he feel relieved.

Joker becomes his true self just before entering the Scene o Murray show.

- "Comedy is subjective muray. Isnt is that what they say"
- "All of you decide what right or wrong, the same way. Whats funny or not"
- "Why all these people are upset about these guys(...) If it was me dyning on the sidewalk you would pass over me"


### Couple of happy Thoughts

### Symbolism

1. Id(Conciosu Artur), Ego(Joker), SuperEgo(social rules and his trained laugh) - Joker starts to be himself when he abandon social rules, and starts acting how "he want and feel about people"

2. His mother represents, self control and obeying the rules of society(Superego). She was a person closest to him, but lied and made him suffer. She represent the hipocricy and the harm which social rules couse to the disabled and poor people.

3. Murrays show always on when on his mother is present - represatation of father figure

4. Wayne is the face of the oppresive social system and hypocrisy.

5. Rats, and facade social rules symbolizes the sickness in which the society is functioning. When joker goes on the killing spree, the social rules are thrown out and the riots opposing the social hierarchy start to rise.

6. Stairs are the representation of struggle. Arthur climb heavilly upwards in the begiing of the movie, and as Joker he dances down from them happily.

7. Television, shows and acting represent the imaginary world in which he exist the more insane he gets. In this world everthing is exagerated and don't have to obey to social rules.

### Everything happens in his head

There are some good indicator that Arthur was locked in hospital for the whole movie
It could all happen in Arthur head in hospital.
    - Social worker who is shown in the begining of th movie resembles psychiatrist at the end of the movie, and Arthur have dark hair instead of light brown in the movie.
    - in the begging of a movie.  His shown in hospital mental hospital, as in the last scene of the movie. "Do you know why you was locked in the hospital?" Social worker asks him at the start.
    - Television gives him material to tell the story of his life in his head. He could imagine hi whole action from the information from the TV
        - The killings of 3 young man - made by some random guy dresed as a clown
        - Thomas Wayne - who is standing for 3 jocks killed by the clown 
        - Identify himself as "the carnival" - his stage name, which he heard also in the radio"
        - He in the murray show
    - He has imaginary meetings with his neghbour 
    - he has to many bullets for a 6shoot revolver to make all the killings. He run out of ammo after subway killings.
    - Hospital allways appears when he meets with psychiatrist or social worker.
    - "For my whole life i didnt knew a really existed, but I do" - to social worker when he thinks he is being reconized in the TV

### Thomas Wayne is really Arthur Fleck Father

Thomas wayne is really jokers father. Penny was working for him and she was atractive woman. Penny wasn't the best mother to Arthur as one of her partners abused him(possibly Thomas Wayne). Penny tells Artur that they made her sign some papers. Probably adoption documents.
 
As Penny writes to Tomhas Wayne. She tought arthur to respond happily to negative situation. She trained him to act happily in stresfull and upleasant situations.

Arthur Has a young Penny photo signed - "Love your smile T. W." - When he is doing making make up for Muray Show. And and he throw it to trash.


### Comedy is subjective murrray - differnet ways to make people laugh

12. Different sources of goiving laughter to people
    - being a victim of violence
    - being an object of joke to laugh - from murray
    - being a clown - from making a fool of yourself
    - being a standuper/ comedian - when people laugh from your jokes - Arthur want to be in this role but he is constnly trated as a victim.

Arthur becomes a Joker - who create subjective comedy where he is the person with power.

### A movie about attention

Arthur lacks attention this movie is all about this abadonment of people mentally ill. Instead of caring people make fun of and osticize people who need attention
- Thomas wayne - "maybe a little attention, maybe a hug dad", "shes crazy"
- Murray - when he make laugh of him and invite him to his show
- Social Worker - when she doesent pay attention, and says that society abandoened him
- His mother - never pays attention to him, and doesen't know that "he never felt happy in his life"
- his co worker - when he gives him gun.

Arthur feel really good when, he can make people laugh, and notice him.
- In murray show - "What do you get, when you cross a loner, with a mentall illenss when society abodened him" "You get what you, f.....g, deserve"

- In the stand up show
- when he fantasize about his neighbour
- at the end of the movie when he dances on the top of the mask of a car.
