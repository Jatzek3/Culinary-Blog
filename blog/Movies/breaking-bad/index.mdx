If you haven't seen Better Call South and Breaking Bad you are in a comfortable position. The last episodes of the prequel series to Breaking Bad, Better Call Saul, are just being realized when I write the review. You can choose to see it by story event order, with Better Call Saul first, or as they were filmed with Breaking Bad first. [Here](https://theyellowpages.live/blog/better-call-saul/)is my review of "Better Call Saul".

### Introduction

Breaking Bad lasts five seasons, each with around twelve episodes. Actors perform very well. Not only lead actors Bryan Cranston(Walter White) and Aaron Paul(Jesse Pinkman), but also many of the supporting ones: Dean Norris(Hank Shrader), Bob Odenkirk(Saul Goodman), Giancarlo Esposito(Gus Fring), and Johnatan Banks(Mike Ehrmentraut). Skylar White(Anna Gun), and Marie Shrader(Betsy Brandt) didn't fit my taste. They seemed pretentious to me.

Most of the time, dialogues are in the range of "screen naturality"(the things people would say in the movies, but not in real life). The technical side don't leave much to ask for. It's a well shot and cut series. The sceneries have this artificial feel, which seems as if fiction and reality blend together. 

### The world and a bit o of plot

The action takes place in the current time when the series was shown, in Albuquerque, New Mexico. In the capital of the state in the center of the USA-Mexican border. People speak Spanish. Cartel is selling and smuggling drugs. The desert and suburbs are most frequent backgrounds.

Walter White is a high school chemistry teacher, recently diagnosed with deadly cancer. His chance of surviving is equal to statistical error. He is a highly skilled chemist and a noble prize winner. 

When he was on police intervention of seizing a methlab. He saw the home laboratory, and his ex-student running away from the police. That leads him to cooperate with Jesse to secure his family's future, and resources for expensive experimental therapy.

### The characters 

The story revolves around Jesse Pinkman and Walter White. During the series, their personality develops. Events, that are happening on and off the screen, affect them. We are presented with fluid, evolving heroes, who are developing throughout the show.

It wouldn't do much harm, if we would name the duo "pinky and the brain". At the start of the series, we meet harmless Walter White, struggling with financial issues, and Jessy Pinkman, unfit to live in the society drug addict. 

#### Walter

Walter gave himself the nickname Heisenberg. He was  early XX century physician. While at home, he plays the role of a caring father. While cooking methamfetamine and making business goes by his pseudonym. With each passing episode, we see transformation. Walter is getting more, and more involved in the drug business, turning into Heisenberg.

His machiavellian side is starting to take over. We can see it in the scenes when his action remains hidden from everyone but the prey. The most memorable moment is when Walter sees Jesse's girlfriend choke on her pukes. Walter doesn't intervene, though he easily could. In this scene,Heisenberg's personality takes over, and Walter starts being only a pose. 

In the end, Walt stops having remorse. Kill anyone who stands in his way, even his coworkers.

### Jesse. 

Jesse, on the other hand, doesn't lose himself in this drug business. He grabs every opportunity to help people in need. With time he stops caring for the money, as he realizes how much suffering it cause.

With time, he grows more down to earth. Realize that there is no place for sympathy beetwen the outlaws. He is acting selflessly. From a helpless drug addict, he learns to be persistent, consequent, and effective.

###  Interpetation

The actions of supporting actors revolve around Jesse and Walter. We see the story and supporting actors in the camera. They are mainly interacting with the main characters.There is  many events not shown on the screen. But they are written so, that we know there is much more to show then we see.

The show uses colors to highlight emotions, advantages and flaws:
- white for intellect, deadliness.
- pink for emotions, luck, and truth.
- yellow is for Mexico and the desert.
- green/azure for money and drugs.
- brown for power and no remorse(Hank, Gus, and Walter dressed in brown). 

Besides colors in names, second names in the show also have meaning:
- Saul goodman - Soul of a goodman.
- Ehrmantraut - is german "before you trust".
- Fring - like fringe science, on the border.

Dialogues often show shifting power between characters during one scene. It seems authentic and makes a great impression.

### Summary

The show is faboulous. There are many treats if you want to get in-depth. I enjoyed seeing it for the second time after watching "Better Call Saul", and I will be happy to see it for the third time.
