### Introduciton

Did you ever want to travel back in time....?
Peaky blinders show on screen how this reality would look. Thankfully we don't have to live in interwar Birmingham. Where Peaky blinders are taking us for the whole six seasons.

We can happily watch the peripeteia of the heroes in our home. Far away from the dangers of early XX century industrial town. Which is depicted accurately. Both from a historical point of view, as for plot Peaky Blinders are filmed remarkably. 

Cillian Murphy stars, as the head of the Shelby gang. I like him very much. This time he created a kind of cult of His and His family gang. 
Other well-played characters are:
- Artur Shelby(Paul Anderson). 
- Alfie Solomons(Tom Hardy) with the role from Taboo, created this dark and resourceful persona 
- Aberama Gold(Aidan Gillen), which played the "Littlefinger" in Games of thrones

The series has was received overpassing any expectations. So well that their people started giving heroes names to their children. So there would be more Tommys, Arthurs, and Ada's since the series was aired.

#### The world 

Tom Shelby is the head of a gang of peaky blinders. They have the name for using razors to cut their enemy's forehead, so the blood will flow on the eyes and blind them. The series of engagements between the gang and other gangs in the United Kingdom, ethnic minorities and other different parties. Tom is not alone in his endeavors, and most often can count on the support of his families and allies. 

The show is  accurate historically. Most of the other groups have existed as well as the Peaky Blinders. There is quite a big attention to detail in that matter. Even the clothes of Peaky Blinders have been adjusted to the original. 

The world is believable and looks similar to what you could expect from this time in England. The plot is entirely made up. Facts are often in service of the story. Historical events have a meaningful impact, but the story isn't driven by them.

### Summary 

I suggest watching peaky blinders. The series echoed in the pop culture, and not without a reason. The strong sides of Peaky Blinders are historical accuracy, the plot, and marvelous acting. 

All Shelby characters and some of the rivaling group's characters are created almost without flaws. Individuality and character development are a great advantage. 

There is also a lot of good music, especially for Radiohead and Nick Cage fans.
