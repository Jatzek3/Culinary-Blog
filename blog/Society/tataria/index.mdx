Before reading, wear your emergency tinfoil hat, because there
will be some alternative history and conspiracy theories included
in this post.

So what is Tartaria? Tartaria is land between Russia and North America,
which was home to Mongol tribes. After the XVI century, there were very few historical resources that happened on these lands. And these are the facts surrounding
the lands of Tartaria.

Some people claim that on this land was an advanced empire. More advanced
than then-contemporary countries. This Empire, according to some, is responsible
for constructing some buildings in the United States. 

All ideas in Tartaria theory, are very often far-fetched, and it is easy
to falsify most of them. Some of the parts of the theory are based on one simple premise and don't take into account official history. 

It is not bad that people, have alternative ideas or different ideologies. Even if it comes to history, we only can tell what is true from historic sources and the belief in the authority of academic mainstream history. So going against the current
and dwelling on the alternative history is challenging, and wouldn't tell that it's stupid.

I think it's a waste of time. Some regions of history have many
sources, are very interesting, and comes close to academic science. As My master thesis
 "Hygiene in XIX century in Warsaw", which prove to be a very interesting topic, 
on which  I still sometimes stumble upon while reading a book or watching some documentary

The Tartaria theory is still very not popular and it's not refined. With time people will
come up with arguments that will be harder to disprove, like with flat earthers.
