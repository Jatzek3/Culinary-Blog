### Introduction

I once heard that role of science fiction novels and movies is to represent a certain subject, some processes in (wyolbrzymioneny) way. Im sure not all sci-fi serve this purpose, and this genre can have other, less enlightened means. Fantasy on the other hand rarely aim to represent reality. More often magicall world created in fantasy novels or movies, serve to tell a story. Which would detach the reader from the world he live in. 

In the Discworld the things have other order. Every tome concentrate around different topic, and seldom the topic don't (nawiązuje) to the (zagadnienia) of the modern world. We can see (odniesienia) to popular culture. Heroes of the novels are described with very distinct features, which make them easy to remember and impersonate. Just like in (bajki) characters represent distinct virtues and values. 

We can very many metaphores and (zagadnień) which are shown in sociological way. To show the things behind the facade. Religion, science, work, power, war, ethics and other values are shown from the side we cannot observe on daily basis, becouse of the taboo/political correctness or other means of mantaining social order. Which tell us not to undermine the sacrum which goes with certain subjects.

Pratchet not only does this in peacefull way. Which shouldnt bother anyone who believe in some of this values, he also does this very large dose of humor. His novels are very entertaining, and the world which he created lives the life of his own, in every novel, even if only part of it is represented.
