In this review, I wanted to concentrate on three problems which movie 
depicts. 
1. Imagination and romantic relations
2. Identity as an image of ourselves and others.
3. Counciosness and memories

Blade runner 2049 begins with a well-directed scene, where two androids
meet, and one eliminates the other. Even though they both are not human, and
human etiquette shouldn't apply to them they still are very polite to each other.
The second thing is that they both understand the meaning of the meeting and how it will proceed and still are unbelievably polite to each other. 

This is an accurate depiction of human relations and behavior, even when you are
in a drastically bad situation you are still expected to play some kind of role. 
Or if you are in a position of power and are to for example fire someone, you
still need to respect the rules of day-to-day politeness. No one should say that the king is naked.

On the other hand, there is a situation, where one android thinks of his executioner as being of one kind with the other, and the executioner distance himself
setting the border and saying that they are not the same. It is a millennia-old topic in every culture of who we perceive to be akin to each other. And it
is used by politicians or ideologists to justify their goals. (For example in Nazi
German Jews were not only portrayed as people of a worse sort but even "insectized").

Hero is first portrayed as an android, which passes "baseline tests"(a test determining
his stability and awareness of being an android) without a problem even after
the elimination of other androids. He is fully loyal and believing in him being artificial. That what potentially change the duality between human and androids
is that the two androids could have a child, which would make the distinction
between humans with souls and androids without them obsolete.

Since the main character is leading the investigation of the child of two androids,
He also gets signs that indicate that he can be that child. And this changes
something in him, he fails the baseline test and starts identifying himself with the androids which he previously hunted.
