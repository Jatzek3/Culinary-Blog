I have managed to set up my blog. It's the first site, which I made from the beginning to the point it is functional and esthetic. It's also useful for me. There are many features to work on. My story with this website hasn't finished.

I watched  MIT 6.042J Mathematics for Computer Science, which was interesting. Not too many useful topics, but it wasn't a waste of time. 

I got accustomed to some hot topics in Modern Web technologies, networks, software engineering. They are available on my blog. 

JavaScript Definitive Guide was very hard to finish. Many topics were described with historical details between browsers. Some topics were outdated, which also gave me some insight into how JavaScript works. A difficult book. It's worthy to read for more experienced and fluent people in JS
