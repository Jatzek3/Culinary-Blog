In this review, I wanted to concentrate on three problems which movie 
depicts. 
1. Imagination and romantic relations.
2. Identity as an image of ourselves and others.
3. Counciosness and memories.

In the movie, the protagonist is in a romantic relationship with a program represented
by a figure of a woman. In one of the first scenes, Joi changes dress and
behavior to be liked by the main character. This shows us to topics:<br/> 
- Is this a real relationship with an artificial program?<br/> 
- How it is different than the relationship between a man and woman? <br/> 
- Are romantic relationships based on attraction and what suits our taste,
instead of love which should be everlasting and not dependant on the situation?

Because of the special device, Joi can accompany, the main character in his daily
endeavors. That leads to her knowing his every action and every secret, 
such as ideation of romantic love and trust in it it.<br/> 
(This feature also is an only common trait across all deities in every religion. 
From my knowledge of evolutionary psychology)

One of the most intriguing scenes in the movie is when Joi orders a prostitute,
which will be a vessel for her so she/it and the main character can have sex.<br/> 
- It asks a question who are you making love to when you are in bed with one person
but fantiseze obut other?<br/> 
-What is authentic in this relation?<br/> 
- Is a real girl better than a program which "is not made of flesh",
because the main character can have sex with her?

Joi also helps the main character and empowers his beliefs. Such as we would like
to be empowered by a real relation. But in real relations, we have other people to deal with, 
and they not always will be sharing our opinion, will sometimes
have different goals. So a relation with Joi is not only unauthentic it is also
dysfunctional when the main character starts to imagine to be the descendant
of two androids.<br/> 
(This drives him away from his job, which is the motor of the plot. And also can be 
interpreted as an existential crisis)

Joi eventually is destroyed by stomping the device by an android who serves to the antagonist.
This is a nice depiction, of shattering someone's dreams, and the difference between
harsh reality and a virtual synthetic world. 

In the end, the end main character meets the big pink Ad of naked Joi which is
advertised as "Joi, everything you want to see".
