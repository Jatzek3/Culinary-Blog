When I was ending my work on Django project Reviews
I started to learn HTML and CSS to add styles to the application. 
And since JavaScript was also the language of the web, I learned the basics of it.
Everything from the "Head First" series which had very pleasant
books to start learning the language, not deep and professional 
though.

So with this knowledge from 4 "Head First Books" quite good
proficiency in Python and latest learning of Computer Science
I enrolled in RS school and benefited from great from the help
of my mentor.

The Program of the school is very hard, and make you learn on 
the topics, by solving mind-bending tasks. The task about CSS and 
HTML was very difficult for me because this was my very first contacts 
with these technologies, but through a big amount of work I could make it work and learned working with them by heart 
(including CSS grid and flexbox)

The JavaScript part was hard but since I knew Python. Learning a new language shouldn't be that hard. I spent some time-solving tasks,
reading "Modern JavaScript Tutorial",
read "JavaScript The Good Parts" and very often worked with documentation
I managed to learn it quite well. JavaScript is a very complex language so 
it takes much more time to learn it than Python.

Learning React for the final task was also a big thing since I didn't have
any contact with this framework till this time. But thankfully maxed out 
in points the "Chat" application(100/100) and exit interview about React-Redux(96/100) 

I finished as 10th of over 200, which I consider a personal success
