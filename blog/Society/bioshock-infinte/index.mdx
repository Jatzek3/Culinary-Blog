### Introduction

Do you like games or movies, with a man and a woman as the main characters?

Do you feel a little tingle inside your belly when you hear the words "science", "religion" or "steampunk"?

Do you like first-person shooters with remarkable story? A story that takes you to a crazy, yet logically consistent alternate world.

If so, You really should check out Bioshock Infinite. Besides being an incredible story, It lets you see the world from a slightly different perspective. And this isn't something that can be easily obtained.


### Welcome to Columbia

We play as Booker de Witt, a thug who has to kidnap a girl from the town of Columbia the pay off his debts. Columbia isn't an old-school ground city in the United States. It flows in the sky. Between the clouds, thanks to discoveries in quantum physics, at the beginning of the twentieth century. Elizabeth is a second character, an attractive and well-read young woman. She has an uncommon power to travel across different versions of history.

This is the main background of the plot. I passed the game once. After a couple of years, I came back to this title. And the story is still an enlighting advantage, which lets you explore the psyche, consciousness, and perception from different angles.

It has also this aspect of unveiling the past, history, and mysteries in each of the characters' lives. The bond between heroes grows stronger with time, as they change through the experiences that they gather. From the story's point of view, Bioshock Infinite is a masterpiece.

### 1st person shooter

As the storytelling goes well, the fighting system has many to improve on. It's something similar to Doom-type games, just with slightly better graphics. It's sometimes tedious, with enemies just outperforming you thanks to a big amount of health or DPM. There was much space to make this game challenging with vigor, a trap system, and different enemies and weapons. 

World creation is exquisite. Types of enemies and their designs are neat. Unfortunately, their performance leaves very much to wish for. Gun handling is at least bad, and everything seems like the minigames from the start of the game.

I'm exaggerating a bit. Headshots are somewhat fun, different enemies require little strategies, there sometimes are puzzle elements in the battle rooms. It is quite an enjoyable experience, but I see it as wasted potential.

In the end, this really doesn't matter, because it's more of a side dish to the story. 

### Summary

I would recommend this game to anybody. If you don't like shooter games, just set the difficulty to easiest.
