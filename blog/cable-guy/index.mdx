After a breakup with a girl, Steven has to return to his unfurnished
apartment. During the first few days, he meets a cable guy which is very eager for his company. The cable guy (Jim Carrey) plays
 a role of very weird acting, lonely and
socially awkward character, and most of the plot of the movie 
revolves around the adventures which are the result of his traits.
The main character is also mentally ill, which unfortunately is portrayed
in stigmatizing way.

The movie is about loneliness and in my opinion about the perception of
lonely, not well-socialized people in society. It's directed and shot
in a comedic way but when you look behind the facade, then you will
see a lot of suffering, striving for company and closeness of others.
The main character indeed is highly skilled socially and can easily
mingle with other people, but it requires him to play a role and act acceptably and this isn't authentic.  
The main character doesn't just want the company of others, he wants to have
meaningful and authentic relations. Want to be simply accepted despite
his awkwardness

The movie doesn't do much good for people, which are struggling to
maintain relationships, because of their traits. The cable guy was lisping
which could lead to his ostracism. The loneliness then influences a 
person so he starts acting awkwardly. The cable guy was watching movies
and I suppose he started acting in the way actors in movies behave.
The plot in a movie shows, that when you engage in people which
act weirdly, you can have very serious negative consequences from it.

So the movie shows the ostracism of some people, but it empowers it instead of criticizing. I think Ben Stiller who was directing the movie, 
didn't knew how to do it and gave different moral meanings in the end.
To not spend so much time in front of the screen, which is very sad because there were so many more lessons to take out of the plot. The
postmodernism autoreference feature was too attractive to the director.
