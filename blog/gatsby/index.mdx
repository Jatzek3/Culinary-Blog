So what is Gatsby? Gatsby is a framework that uses 
React and GraphQL to create static pages from the data.

This can be very confusing even for people, who know GraphQL
and React so I will try to explain clearly how Gatsby, so it will be
easy to understand even for people who are not close to IT

When going on a website, more often than not, there are some similar
elements on the website for example a header and footer. Gatsby with the help of React gives the possibility to create the code once
and then reuse it.

When You have to move from one part of the website, using an internal link,
Gatsby with the help of React allows you to not load all the contents 
once more, and a new site appears instantly.

Gatsby with GraphQL allows a direct connection with the database and fetching
only the information needed. You can configure or create the backend of 
GraphQl, but if the application is small, you can create a perfectly working
site without touching too much backend. 

When you want to add a new article to the site, you don't have to add the whole structure of the element and configure the links to the new site.
Gatsby gives you the possibility of including simple text and image files by hand
and Gatsby will create them in the way which we specified beforehand.

Besides this, if you are not very close to computers, Gatsby allows you to 
use plugins that can give you easy use Administrative Panel from WordPress,
or other Content Management systems.
