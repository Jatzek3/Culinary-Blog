1. There is one remarkable vido worth watching on You tube regarding VPNs. Its quite short and intersting.

1. What is VPN
    - Na początku były używane przez pracodawców, żeby dać możliwość pracy zdalnej
    - Tunnel Protocol? - jeżeli nastapiło naruszenie bezpieczeństwa sieci połączenie zmienia sposób łączenia
    - szyfrowanie danych i Vpn mówią że chronią adresy użytkowników
    How it works
    - User
    - ISP - Cannot see what site are you using
    - VPN 
    - Internet
    Free VPN are selling the data, becouse to operate they have to have money.
    - Free aren't worth it

2. Wi-fi today is secure. It was otherwise couple of years ago but now is ok.
    - today thanks to encryption and new algorithms is ok (WPA, WPA 2)

3. Are you secure today?
    Most sites uses HTTPS today. If those thay don't or can be of security concern you are warned while coming to the websited with a huge warning sign, blocking the site. 
    Even if you go to those websites it, any password of information shouldn't be automatically leaked.
    If security is concerned, most systems have antivirus and firewall installed.
    Military grade encription is today used in all browsers whith HTTPS
    - HTTPS - 
            - Computerfile friendly movie about TLS https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TLDTodL7Lc
            I wrote Two technical article which are less interesting.
            - Technical article abut HTTP nad HTTPS https://theyellowpages.live/blog/http/
            - Technial article about the security side of HTTPS https://theyellowpages.live/blog/tls/



5. Prviacy. If you are afraid of spying on you by Internet Provider. 
    - Getting torrents online
    - If You are in China, Russia, Belarus or other country which can be blocking on spying on you
    - You want to use content blocked in your country on specific websites(Netflix)
    - Want to be sure that no one will know about your sexuality, or things you are browsing
    - Have some vicious intensions, and want to hide your network activity
    - You don't want to be in future recreated by robots in virtual reality to study human behaviour

6. The VPNs are logging
    - Some logging is necesserly to make it work - are they purging the data?
    - But for the law reasons it can be enforced, so data from VPNs can lead to helping crime activities.
    - If it really wouldn't do that it could lead to use it instead of Tor.
    - Costumer wouldn't know if they were spyied upon
    - Cmpromised would likely go out of busiines
        - PureVPN logs was used to arrest Ryan Lin in 2017
        - Still in Byssiness
        - NordVPN hacked in 2018 from a remote computer. 
    - Often if someone doing something socially unecptable, or breaking the law then they need the privacy.
    - So organizing VPN can be profitable if you want to have base of illicit activies.

7. Many people want to keep them privacy safe 
    - It can be better to hide own behaviour before your boss or ISP, then from a Goverment or companies for ads
   Want to downloud some torrents feeling safe.
   Or live in the country which restricts and spies on Internet users.
    - It can be worth to use VPNs

    Using Tor or creating VPNs are better options (difficult for standard user)
