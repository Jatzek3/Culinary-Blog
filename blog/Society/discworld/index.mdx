Some things happen at an appropriate time in your life. You are a newborn, then you grow up, and then you get old. If you did not have the pleasure to read at least some novels from Terry Pratchett's "Discworld", I'm sure you are missing some steps between being born and dying.

### Some pieces of reality placed between the lines

I once heard that the role of science fiction novels and movies is to represent a certain subject, some processes exaggeratedly. I'm sure not all sci-fi serves this purpose, and this genre can have other, less enlightened means. Fantasy on the other hand rarely aims to represent reality. More often magical worlds created in fantasy novels or movies, serve to tell a story. Which would detach the reader from the world he lives in. 

In the Discworld, things have other order. Every tome concentrates on a different topic, and seldom the topic doesn't refer to the topic of the modern world. We can see reference to popular culture. Heroes of the novels are described with very distinct features, which make them easy to remember and impersonate. Just like fairy-tale characters represent distinct virtues and values. 

We can very many metaphors and issues that are shown in a sociological way. To show the things behind the facade. Religion, science, work, power, war, ethics, and other values are shown from the side we cannot observe daily, because of the taboo, political correctness, or other means of maintaining social order. Which tells us not to undermine the sacrum that goes with certain subjects.

Pratchett not only does this in a peaceful way. This shouldn't bother anyone who believes in some of these values, he also does this very large dose of humor. His novels are very entertaining, and the world which he created lives the life of his own, in every novel, even if only part of it is represented.

### Summary

I was amazed by the lecture on the adventures which happened in the 'Discworld'. I'm more stunned that the whole series is quite family-friendly, with little violence, sexual interactions are only mentioned and very rarely direct way. This magical world creates the image of a fairy tale with attached very deep and thoughtful anecdotes.

Great lecture if someone stumbles upon it and can get sucked into it, it will be him memorable and exciting experience
