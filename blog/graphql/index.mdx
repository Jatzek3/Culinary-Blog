GraphQL is a query language for APIs and a runtime for fulfilling those queries 
with your existing data. GraphQL provides a complete and understandable 
description of the data in your API, gives clients the power to ask for 
exactly what they need and nothing more, makes it easier to evolve APIs
over time, and enables powerful developer tools.

This is the description of GraphQL on the main site of GraphQL. It 
can be quite difficult to understand, so I will try to explain in simpler words
what GraphQL does and why it is worth using it.

When a user clicks on a certain interactive part of a website, sometimes
there is a need to put some data into the database or fetch them from the database.
And GraphQL is a way of transmitting this data so no more than needed are injected into the database or read from it.

You can select exactly which data you want from the database, and it is sometimes very useful. Part for 

On other hand, it is also easy for frontend developers to write simple 
applications without the need of constructing server-side code, because
modern frameworks like for example gatsby inject the data and transform them
from for example directory structure.

While on the frontend GraphQL can be very easy and useful, on the backend
it seems a bit harder to write it than SQL(Structured Query Language -
the standard language of databases). And SQL I think will be often default 
way of fetching data.
