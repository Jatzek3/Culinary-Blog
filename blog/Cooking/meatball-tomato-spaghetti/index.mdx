### Ingredients:

- oil
- 1/2 cup of flour

### Meatballs:

- 1/2 cup of breadcrumbs
- 2 teaspoons of dijon mustard
- 500g ground meat(beef, pork, or mixed)
- 1 large egg
- 1 grated peperoncino/1 teaspoon of chili flakes
- 3 cloves of pressed garlic
- 1/2 medium onion, finely grated
- salt, pepper

### Sauce:

- 1/2 medium-size onion, finely diced
- 3/4 liter of tomato juice
- 2 garlic cloves, finely sliced
- 1 cube of beef stock
- 2 bay leaf
- 4 allspice balls
- salt, pepper

### Method:

1. Mix all the ingredients for meatballs in a large bowl.
2. When the texture will be uniform, form them into small 2cm balls.
3. Put flour on the saucer, and coat each meatball in it.
3. Heat the pan with ~5 tablespoons of oil to medium. Place all 
meatballs on the pan, turning them from time to time until browned
on all sides. It should take 10-15 min. Check the largest meatball, if it's ready, by tasting it.
4. Transfer meatballs to a plate.
5. Pour three tablespoons of oil on the same pan, on medium heat.
Add onion and garlic, fry them for 5 minutes. Add tomato juice/canned tomatoes,
bay leaves, allspice balls, salt, pepper, and a cube of beef stock.
6. Turn the heat up to high, stir it for some time. When tomato juice, will be close to the boiling point,
turn the heat to low. Place the lid on the pan. Cook for 45 min.
7. Check the taste. If it's too spicy add some juice, otherwise salt, and pepper to taste.
8. It will be very good with any pasta, but with spaghetti it's iconic.
9. Buon appetito.

### Footnotes:

- You can add herbs to the sauce: parsley, basil, oregano. Fresh or dried 
according to taste.
- If you like, you can add grated cheese on top of the dish.
- There is no reason to use Olive Oil instead of Oil. 
- I recommend making 2x the ingredients and freezing for later. There is quite a lot of work in making this dish.
