### Servings: 1-2

Here is another idea for scrambled eggs. You probably hadn't thought
about this mix, though it's really interesting 

I suggest You try this one:

### Ingredients:

- A tablespoon of butter
- 1 medium-sized sausage(10cm - 15cm ), diced
- 4 eggs
- 2 teaspoons of dijon mustard
- salt, pepper


### Method:

1. Put butter on a pan on medium heat until it melts.
2. Put diced sausage on the pan and fry it for about 3 minutes
2. Crack the eggs onto the pan, add mustard.
4. Stir the eggs from time to time on the pan until they will
have desired consistency.
5. Salt and pepper to taste.
6. Serve with toasts or slices of bread.
