### Servings: 6

Spaghetti Bolognese is a good idea for Sunday dinner.
When you meet with your family. Want to cook something good what everyone knows and enjoys. I'm used to
cooking it simply without carrot, celery, and ground pork instead of beef. 
I advise you to use pork because, in
my opinion, ground beef has to strong taste and can be too fatty. I once used ground beef and wasn't happy with the result.
It is a good idea to mix the ground pork with ground beef.

### Ingredients:
- 1 onion 
- 1 carrot 
- 3-4 garlic cloves
- 400-500g of ground meat
- 500g of tomato passata 
- 3 teaspoon tomato puree 
- 0,5l of beef stock 
- salt, pepper
- 4 balls of allspice
- 2 bay leaves
- papardelle, tagliatelle or penne pasta
- Grated cheese to serve

### Method:

1. Thinly dice the onion and carrots, slice the garlic. Pour some oil into the pan.
2. Put the onions on the pan on medium for 5 minutes. Afterward, add
garlic and carrots for 10-15 minutes.
3. If your Pan is big enough (It should hold at least 2 liters), put the meat into vegetables.
Otherwise, put some oil and vegetables into the bigger pot on medium heat, 
and cook the meat on the smaller pan until the meat isn't raw.
4. Transfer the meat to vegetables, add tomatoes, 0,5 liter of beef stock, salt, pepper, bay leaves, and allspice. 
Bring the temperature too high until boiling, and then turn it too low.
5. Cook the sauce for about 2 hours, check for density and add tomato puree. 
Spice it to your taste. 
6. Serve with pasta and grated cheese

Enjoy your meal!

### Footnotes:
- I always made this sauce with spaghetti. Since spaghetti is so commonly associated with bolognese ragu. 
But it is better to cook it with pasta, which makes the sauce and pieces of meat stick together.
- Many recipes add 2-3 celery sticks, diced with carrot. I don't like celery and didn't like it in the ragu
either.
- You can add milk after two hours of cooking. Milk softens the sour tomato taste.
- You can cook longer the ragu. The longer, the better it will be. Four hours is optimal I think.
