2. Cast

- Ruth,Langmore ++
- Wendy Byrde(its hard to play such a frantic and manipulative role, at one time you are not sure if Wendy is faking or manipulating +, Very chaotic and controversial character) -
- Secondary roles big big + mostly.
3. Story
- accountant gets involved into drug cartel reckoning.

- Action of buying business, drugs(the redneck Snells family), FBI, people getting killed constatly, Cartel local police investigations, Kansas City Mafia, Mental Illnes (Marty after investigation Wendies brother), characters stepping out of their moral code (preacher, and Slicky lipz "manager")
