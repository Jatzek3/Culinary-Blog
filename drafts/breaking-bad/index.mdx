If you haven't seen both Better Call South and Breaking Bad you are in comfortable position. (Similar to that who havent seen star when "Episode 3: Revenge of the Sith" was shown in Cinema). The last episodes of prequel series to the Breaking Bad, Better Call Saul, is just beening realed when I write the review. You can choose to see it by story event order with Better Call Saul first, or as they were filmed with Breaking Bad first.
