I ended my work in sales in the pursuit of learning
to program.

 I remember very well writing my first simple games
while learning from - "Learn Python the Hard Way" and getting 
introduced to programming in a difficult way from which I 
benefited very much.

The next thing was Tim Buchalkas "Learn Python Programming Masterclass"
Which introduced me to a deeper depth of thinking of programming in Python.
Very good and long tutorial and very adequate for my time of learning.
It was recommended to me, by my cousin. He was also an inspiration for me to switch fields to programming.

Through research, I came to study "Learning Python";
a Book by Mark Lutz, which can give you an in-depth understanding of Python. In my opinion, it is a necessary lecture for every aspiring Python programmer.
Thanks to studying it, I  understood how Python works.

At this time, I was also solving some problems on CodeWars.
