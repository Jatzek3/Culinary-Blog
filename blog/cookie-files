You might be wandering where the browser keeps information.
There are three methods where the they are stored:
*Cookies
*Local Storage
*Session Storage

Cookies are small messages(4kb), which website send to you your 
browser and then it is saved until it expires (or the browser window is closed
if the expiry date isn't passed in the cookie. Storing information in
cookies is relatively if they are encrypted. But still even encrypted
information can get in to wrong hands, and be used in malicious ways, 
so there shouldn't be any criticall unsecured data in cookies like passwords
or credit card numbers.

Local Storage is a Javascript object which is placed in the browser, it
has 5MB of capacity. It is very easy to enter from the developer point of 
view and allows for getting by without accessing backend. Since it is
a Javascript object it can be easily entered and injected with malicious 
code. According to the author of the article, there are massive ammount of 
tutorials, materials which teach storing Jason Web Tokens(JWT - a sample of
code which identifies a person entering from the browser) in Local Storage
What is very unsecure and you should never store sensitive information in
local storage, especcialy JWT.

Local storage is good for information that:
*Is not at all sensitive
*Doesn’t need to be used in an ultra high performance app
*Isn’t larger than 5MB
*Consists of purely string data

Session Storage

Session Storage is simmilar to Local Storage(it also has 5MB), but it expieres at
the end of the session, which doesen't make it that much more safe
since your information can be stolen while using the unsecured website.
