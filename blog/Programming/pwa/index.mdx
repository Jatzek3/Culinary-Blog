modern web technologies but acts and feels like a mobile app"

Long story short

Progressive Web Apps are websites, which you can download and 
launch them offline, have a good experience without fast internet
connection, user interface adapts to your device, the website is accessible 
for people with disabilities. 

This is a very short description for not tech-savvy people. 
Google created a standard for creating websites named Progressive Web Apps.
It is not one technology, like React and its ecosystem, 
but a collection of techniques that allow you to build the website in a way that enhances user experience. The range of techniques ranges
from using the newest features of HTML5 in the browser to server security.

Most important parts of PWA:
- downloadable application thanks to JavaScript manifest
- works offline, without the browser interface 
- allows push notifications
- secured connection through SSL
- service workers provide a smooth user experience and allow caching
- design is adaptive to the screen size
- content is accessible for people with disabilities
- can be accessed from any input device, keyboard, mouse, touchscreen 

This specification has been shown to greatly increase traffic in some commercial applications.
It is most usefull for phones with Android.
