### Ingredients:

- 2 tablespoons of olive oil

- 1 medium-size onion, diced
- 500g of carrots, sliced thickly
- 300g of potatoes, cut into smaller parts

### Spices: 

- 1 chicken/vegetable stock cube
- salt

1. Put the olive oil into the pot, heat it to medium. Put the onion and garlic in the pot, turn
the temp to low, and cook them for 5-7 min untill the onion shrinks.
2. Add the rest of the vegetables and boiling water, so water will cover the vegetables.
3. Add all of the spices. Stir for a while. Then cook on low heat the soup, under the lid for about 20 min, until the potatoes soften.
4. Turn off the gas and let it rest for 10 minutes. 
5. Add milk and mix everything with blender.
