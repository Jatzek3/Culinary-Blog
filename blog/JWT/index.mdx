"JSON Web Tokens (JWT) is a JSON-encoded representation 
of a claim or claims that can be transferred between two parties."

A JWT is a mechanism that allows verifying the owner of some data.
The information in the JWT is not encrypted and can be seen
by anyone who intercepts it. So while using JWT it's highly recommended to use HTTPS.

It's not recommended to use JWT as session tokens. This means JWT
should remain longer in your browser to be useful. They cannot be invalidated
at the end of a session and are relatively large.

You never should store JWT in local storage, because it's easily
accessible for hacker attacks. You should store JWT's in httpOnly cookie
which is a special cookie never accessible from JavaScript in the browser.
