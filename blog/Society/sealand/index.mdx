Sealand has a long and colorful history, which makes it 
one of the best micronations. It gives you an inside look 
into the creation of Sealand, its independence, and its role in international news.

The story of Sealand begins with a pirate radio station.
In 1966, Roy Bates, an entrepreneur and former British 
Army Major had a crazy idea: Start a tax-free radio 
station on an abandoned World War II sea fort. 
The fort was located 7 miles off the coast of Britain,
which meant that it was outside of British jurisdiction. 
So when Bates and his wife Joan moved onto the platform 
they christened “Sealand”, and essentially created
their own country.

The Principality of Sealand claims ownership over roughly 0.004 km2 of territory,
The claimed territory is classified as terra nullius—land no one owns—as under international law. 

In 1967 they decided, it was time to proclaim Roughs Towers an independent nation. On September 2nd of that year, Bates declared himself 
"Prince Roy" and his wife became "Princess Joan." 
He then hoisted a flag, bearing the words "Sealand" and
"My Sealand", while his wife stood beside him on a wooden 
deck built on the two towers.

However, in 1978, German entrepreneur and long-time Sealand supervisor Alexander Achenbach seized control 
of the platform and kept it for himself. The Bates family counter-attacked and retook their territory.

The nation's independence was not recognized by any other country.
To this day, Sealand is run as a principality under English law and is still governed by Bates' son, Prince Michael.

Sealand is a micronation that claims to be an independent sovereign state. 
It consists of a former World War II military structure located at the eastern end of the Rough Sands, 
about 7 miles (11 km) off the coast of Suffolk, England.

Sealand has no formal recognition as a country by the United Nations or any other international body. 
The British government does not recognize it as a separate territory, and its inhabitants do not pay taxes 
or receive official documentation such as passports, driving licenses, or national insurance contributions.
Sealand's self-proclaimed independence remains controversial, and the country has been involved in several 
legal disputes with the United Kingdom regarding the platform's status since its creation.

I think Sealand is the most interesting of all the micronations. 
History buffs will enjoy learning about its past, and political wonks will appreciate hearing about its ongoing legal battles. 
Whether you’re a history buff, a political science nerd, or just looking for an entertaining read, Sealand is worth knowing about.
