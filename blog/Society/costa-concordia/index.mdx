Ship of dreams, which cost 570 mln dollars, Costa Concordia. Resemble
the tragic story of Titanic, where Incompetence and bad decisions of a captain lead to sinking of the ship. This Captain rouse through the ranks in very unclear circumstances, in 4 years from a position of head of security to the position of a Captain. And in his career, he already had two major accidents
with other ships.

But not only the Captain was unqualified for the job. His helmsman had received a job after trying his strength in painting and cleaning, and he had a rock-bottom salary
for the position, didn't speak well Italian or English. This language barrier, excessive
speed, and not taking into account safety rules eventually lead to the crash, 
risking lives and major financial losses.

Accidents happen, and the sinking of the ship was the fault of these two 
individuals, which both of them were inappropriate people for the job. But the action
of Captain Francesco Schettino after the ship was damaged risked the lives of 
hundreds of people:
- indecisiveness to announce an evacuation
- lying to the people on the ship about the severity of the situation
- lying to the coastal guards and superiors about the state of the ship 
- getting from the ship civilian dressed and one of the first leave

As a result of the catastrophe, 32 people died, 64 were injured. Ship was completely
lost, and the experts estimated the amount of compensation for at least 500 mln USD
