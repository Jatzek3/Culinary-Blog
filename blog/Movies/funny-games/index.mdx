### Introduction

Michael Haneke( "White Ribbon", "La Pianiste") wrote and directed Funny Games in 1997. 

This movie in the first version was completely acceptable, and nothing special needed to be added. But Haneke remade it in 2007. This time with Tim Roth, Naomi Watts, and Michael Pitt.

Both versions are worth watching. If I had to choose I would pick the one with Naomi Watts. Besides the actors, there are no meaningful differences.

### How it begins

Funny Games start with a family driving a car and guessing classical musicians. This scene is interrupted by loud metal music. This interruption made a shocking impression on me. 

The plot of the movie begins when a boy in white clothes, wearing white gloves comes to the family's house to borrow some eggs. He behaves very politely, but with time acts pushier and pushier. Soon a second boy joins the scene, similarly dressed as the first one. They both are transgressing women's boundaries while acting very politely. 

### Interpetation

Both evil characters remind me of the protagonists from Stanley Kubrick's Clockwork Orange. I think this is indeed intentional. Both movies are touching the subject of "Nature vs Nurture". Both movies present a similar stage of young men invading the house of middle-class sophisticated people.

While behaving gently, intruders are acting very aggressively. They start behaving violently under certain conditions. When someone stops acting gently and starts to be pushy or when the current game demands it. Moral rules don't apply to them, only the rules of good behavior. At one moment, they play the game to obey the rules of the father, who is the captain of a ship. Even then father doesn't ask them to leave.

Boys introduce themselves with many names from popular culture, Tom and Jerry, Beavis and Buthead, Peter and Paul. In the ending subtitles, they are called Peter and Paul. Which is a clear reference to religion. While the movie is about morality and rules of good behavior, it only touches on the topic of religion.

Michel Hanneke is from Austria, a country where Adolf Hitler was born, and which greeted him with open Arms in 1938. Funny Games can be viewed as a metaphor for what can happen if only the rules of good behavior apply without morality.  

### Summary

There is more to this movie than what I've written. The ending adds some flavor. The movie is worth watching even without an over-intellectualized interpretation. If you want to watch something disturbing with many possibilities of interpretation then Funny Games won't be a waste of time.
