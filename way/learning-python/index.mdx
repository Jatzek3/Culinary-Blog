I ended my work were in IT sales in the pursuit of learning
to program. I remember very well writing my first simple games
while learning from - "Learn Python the Hard Way" and getting 
introduced to programming in a very difficult way from which I 
benefited very much.

The next thing was Tim Buchalkas "Learn Python Programming Masterclass"
Which introduced me to a bigger depth of thinking of programming in Python.
Very good, long tutorial and very adequate for my time of learning.
It was recommended to me by my cousin who was also an inspiration for me to switch fields to programming.

And then through some research, I came to study "Learning Python". 
A Book by Mark Lutz can give you a very well in-depth understanding 
how Python works. In my opinion, it is a necessary lecture for every Python programmer
Thanks to reading it really could understand, for
the time, how Python works.

In this time I was also solving some problems on CodeWars and Practice Python 
(https://www.practicepython.org/)
