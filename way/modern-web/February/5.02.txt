Today I've fixed the internet connection, almost by myself. This almost everytime takes
90% of time fixing, but it's a process.

Today i watched Next.js Tutorial by The Net Ninja. I see that it will be more complicated
then gatsby is. There is many hard JavaScirpt to understand underneath, and even though

mixes already complicated things, and add some problems from itself.
