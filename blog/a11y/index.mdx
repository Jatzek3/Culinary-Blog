In day-to-day life, disabled people struggle with many barriers.
It is an unnecessary difficulty for them to deal with similar obstacles
on the internet. Accessibility is a term describing various methods
and norms to facilitate using the internet for people with different
kinds of disabilities.

I was auditing websites for compliance with accessibility standards,
and can give quick hints, how to make the website accessible:
- write semantic HTML
- provide alt attributes for images
- take care that your website colors have high contrast
- check if you can go through all the content on your website using a keyboard
(keep pressing Tab on each of your sites)

If you want your website to be as much accessible as it can, then go through
all WCAG standards on your own, then verify your website W3C HTML and CSS validator.
Using ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) often leads to many problems,
so try using it as least as you can. If you can avoid using forms, you should consider it; it's difficult to write an accessible webpage with forms.

Using React without server rendering creates an inaccessible application.
If you think that you don't have to care about disabled people watching your website, not only you're a bad person, but also you aren't right. Because about 
10% of people have some kind of disability, and making your site accessible will make it easier for people with visual impairments.

And if this doesn't change your mind, a11y is good for SEO.
