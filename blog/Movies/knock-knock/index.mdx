### Introduction

I stumbled upon "Knock Knock" after seeing it on a list of hidden Netflix gems

(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4G2PisM1-so)

I liked it very much, and It reminded me of Funny Games by Haneke.

Besides Knock Knock, Eli Roth also directed slashers like Hostel, Hostel 2, and Cabin Fever. He helped Quentin Tarantino while filming Inglorious Bastards, in whom he also starred as Donny Donnovitz.

Keanu Reeves besides being "the One" in Matrix, is the one who made a gigantic contribution to the Value of the movie. The male part of the audience can be very sympathetic to his role and character. After this movie, I feel closer to Keanu himself, and it's not easy since he is the most caring and lovable person in Hollywood. Watching Anna de Armas at the start of her movie career was nice. She gave a good performance and is very good-looking. It was nice to see these two actors. Lorenza Izzo performed ok.

### A little bit of plot

The title itself refers to Funny Games, as "knock knock" is a childish game. In the first scene, as in Funny Games, we observe how the family spends their time together. In this scene, Keanu Reaves starts to scare children and calls himself "the Monster". This act of playing we can interpret as a metaphor for actions to come. 

As in Funny Games, the family scene is interrupted by loud rock music. Evan, the father of the children and exemplary husband, is drinking wine and preparing himself to smoke marihuana. 

When Ben and Genesis knock on the door, and Evan invites them, his fate is decided. As it is decided in Funny Games when the mother invited the first boy. Girls are behaving more and more flirty, crossing Evan's boundaries. As in Funny Games, the violence is involved, in Knock Knock sex is. Father resists, but the girls persistently drag him into her game.

### Interpretation

I've had a reflection on the plot. Bel and Genesis are trying to fit into the sweet and stupid girl stereotype, that supposedly turns men on. I think, it works on those, who are close to popular culture, and treat it as authentic behavior. Pop science explains, that men are more interested in women who are dumber than them. Since she won't undermine the position of the men in the family, I won't dwell on this line of reasoning. I didn't read enough and cannot cite credible sources. The studies are often not precise, and conclusions from them change from time to time.

If this sweet and stupid acting stereotype exists in hookup culture, why appearances of high status are also a way of playing the game of seduction? Maybe it's not about what cliche you are about to recreate, but how well you can pretend specific behavior from popular culture? As for me, being flirty means behaving artificially in a game that is fake itself. As in "Breakfast in Tiffany", only people faking appearances fall for fake appearances

The interesting thing in the movie is, how people behave in the position of power, and when they are in the position of a victim. It changes in a moment when the girls get the upper hand on Evan. It is interesting to look at this whole movie from a Transactional Analysis perspective -> https://theyellowpages.live/blog/ta-foundations/

Evan is a sophisticated caring father, and on the other side "the Monster". Who appears when Evan shows his basic instincts. It could be the goal for girls since they are joyful when Evan turns into a "Monster".

Girls devastate the works of Evan's wife. It can be interpreted as:
 - commentary on modern art. ;)
 - can be a metaphor for destroying a family by an unfaithful father.
 - or just a simple demonstration of violence and power over the Evans family.

### Summary

There are a ton of similarities between Funny Games and Knock Knock. Both movies give a lot of place for interpretation. If you're not interested in comparing both films and want to spend the evening enjoyably, then there are Beautiful actresses, Keanu Reeves, and a lot of action.

This movie was a remake of the 1974 movie Death Game. The original film is a simple movie about two girls taking revenge on a man for sexual harassment. I recommend you this Youtube video so you can see how much personal relation matters in showbiz -> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwfmiR1jFMc
