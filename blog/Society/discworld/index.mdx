Some things happen in apropriate time in your life. You are a newborn, then you grow up, and then you get old. If you hadnt have the plaeasure to read at leat some novels from Terry Pratchets "Discworld" im sure that you are missing some steps beetween being born and dying.

### Some pieces of reality placed beetween the lines

I once heard that role of science fiction novels and movies is to represent a certain subject, some processes in  exaggerated way. Im sure not all sci-fi serve this purpose, and this genre can have other, less enlightened means. Fantasy on the other hand rarely aim to represent reality. More often magicall world created in fantasy novels or movies, serve to tell a story. Which would detach the reader from the world he live in. 

In the Discworld the things have other order. Every tome concentrate around different topic, and seldom the topic don't (nawiązuje) to the (zagadnienia) of the modern world. We can see (odniesienia) to popular culture. Heroes of the novels are described with very distinct features, which make them easy to remember and impersonate. Just like fairy-tail characters represent distinct virtues and values. 

We can very many metaphores and (zagadnień) which are shown in sociological way. To show the things behind the facade. Religion, science, work, power, war, ethics and other values are shown from the side we cannot observe on daily basis, becouse of the taboo, political correctness or other means of mantaining social order. Which tell us not to undermine the sacrum which goes with certain subjects.

Pratchet not only does this in peacefull way. Which shouldnt bother anyone who believe in some of this values, he also does this very large dose of humor. His novels are very entertaining, and the world which he created lives the life of his own, in every novel, even if only part of it is represented.

### Summary

Im amazed by the lecture of the advantures which happend in the 'Discworld'. Im more stunned that the whole series is quite family friendly, little violence, sexual interactions are only mentioned and very rarely direct. This magical world creates the image of a fairy tale with attached very deep and thoughtfull anecdotes.

Game of thrones is brutal fantasy, which (czerpie) from history, and which (wyolbrzymia) brutality and harsh life of middleages. It enlarges what is worse in reality. The Discworld by Terry Pratchet implodes history and show metaphorically how the world works in quite family friendly way.

Great lecture if someone stumble upon it and can get sucked into, it will be for him memorable and exciting expierence
