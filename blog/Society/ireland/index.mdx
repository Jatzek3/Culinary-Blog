### Introduction

Dublin, a long novel written by Edward Rutherfurd, is the first part of the Saga. Ireland is the second part of Saga. They both span over 1600 pages.

Each chapter describes the lives of members of families in the background of historical events. The books are a fine read, especially for those who enjoy history.

Edward Rutherfurd is a pen name of Francis Edward Wintle. He was born in 1948. Then he graduated from the University of Cambridge, and Stanford Bussiness School. After graduating, he worked in political research, bookselling, and publishing. He left his career in 1983 and started writing "Sarum", a historical novel that describes events of over ten thousand years.

Sarum was published in 1987 and became an international best-seller. Remained for 23 weeks on New York Times Bestseller List. After this, he wrote seven more books which became bestselling titles.1

### Description

The main plot revolves around the history of six families:
- The O’Byrnes - ancestors of the High King of Ireland
- The MacGowan's - pre-Celtic craftsmen and merchants
- The Harolds/Doyles - Viking families of farmers and merchants
- The Walshes - Flemish knights settling in Ireland after Strongbow’s Anglo-Norman invasion in the 12th century
- The Tidies - English craftsmen arriving in medieval times
- The Budges - protestant zealots who fight catholicism. 2

Each chapter tells the story of people from different families. To my dislike, the main characters of the chapters are seldom the same, as in previous ones. The author invents new characters which are then placed in one of six family trees. They have some similar traits and are linked with each other by blood. It's convenient for the writer, but not so convenient for the reader.

Fortunately, there are family trees added at the begging of the book. So it is easier to understand kinship. Maps are similarly prepended. The book tells a story about several locations, but the historical events are happening on the whole Irish Iland. Often different lands are mentioned in regards to the Irish insurrections.

Dublin book is about the medieval history of the Irish Island. How the Catholicism had spread, the meaning of religion on the Island. How it shaped the Irish identity. It is also about the contact with the Welsh, Vikings, and English. How cultural differences can be an obstacle to contact between people.

Irland tells the history of post-medieval Ireland. It was the time under the rule of Protestant England. It was more often than not, favored by The King of England. Catholicism was the main religion for the Irish People. In the face of sanctions started to convert to Protestant confession.

Irish Insurrections, Oliver Cromwell's invasion, Great Irish Hunger, and First World War. Those are some of the events described. Regrettably, the events are often modestly depicted. 

### Summary
    
The books are written in very light language, and the events also are depicted in an orderly fashion. That makes the novel very easy and pleasant to read.

The author swiftly manages family trees. Even one family tree could be difficult to manage easily, not to mention genealogical trees of six families. The author chooses specific and distinct characters to be in the spotlight of each chapter. The characters described in the book are included in the family tree. Both books contain simplified genealogical trees. 

There are some clever parts of the novel. It was indeed a treat for me to read these parts. The rest of the book is well-paced and very even. 

There was too little history described. And even in these historical events, the author added much fiction. Often there is one sentence about historical fact, and this is it.

Characters in the book appear mostly in one chapter in person. Then the characters of previous chapters, are mentioned to show kinship and relations. That creates an impression of a collection of short stories.

Dublin and Ireland are prime novels, and I could recommend them to anyone who seeks something educational and fun.
