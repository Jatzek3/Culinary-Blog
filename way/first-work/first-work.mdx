Thanks to my colleague recommendation, quite good fluency
in Python, for the time of learning and some basic knowledge 
about computer science, I got my first job as a software engineer.

I think that I had too little understanding of network administration
and low-level programming for the time.
Even though work didn't provide me
with many challenges, and I put  much effort into my job, 
my more experienced colleagues gave me bad reviews at the end of my trial period.

Based on this, I think my boss didn't have the choice to propose to me
extension of the contract, so our cooperation came to an end.
