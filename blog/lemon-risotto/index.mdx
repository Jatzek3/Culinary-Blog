Working/unemployed class way of making a quite sophisticated dish. As always I'm using only the simplest ingredients in my recipe, so You won't have to go some posh shop on the other side of the town to buy shallots for half of your paycheck. It's still
very good and is very easy.

Ingredients:

- 1 onion, finely chopped
- 1 cup (250ml) of white rice
- 2 cups of boiling water
- 3 tablespoons of oil/olive oil/butter
- 1 lemon
- 1 tablespoon of butter
- 50g of finely grated cheese

Spices:
- 1 teaspoon of turmeric
- 1 cube of chicken stock
- salt and pepper 

1. Heat the oil and pan to medium.
2. Once hot, add onion and keep it for  5-8 minutes on the pan. Till
the onion is soft.
3. Add rice, boiling water, turmeric, a cube of chicken stock, a little bit
of salt and pepper, and stir for 1 minute.
4. Cook on low for about 15 minutes under a lid. Add the juice from the lemon, butter, and grated cheese.
5. Check the taste and the softness of rice. If it is not ready, cook for a while
longer, spice it to your liking.

footnotes:
- I didn't see too many people using turmeric in this dish. I think it adds
a lot of flavors, and also a lemon color.
- I didn't include lemon zest. I don't think it has its place and would be better
fitting if there would be no turmeric(for color)
