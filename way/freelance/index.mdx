At the end of RS School, I started applying for jobs. With 
React and Redux quite well studied, whole basic knowledge of 
backend and some computer science, feeling quite well with 
HTML, CSS, and JS I felt optimistic about my chances.

RS school was extended with Angular tasks, in which I decided
to participate. For a whole month, I studied the structure of the Angular framework. I think it is very difficult to get a grip on it, but when
you will wrap your mind around it, it can work well in specific applications.

I had quite many invitations to recruitment processes,
quite often went whole the way through the process, and the technical interviews also went well. Therefore I was often disappointed
when I didn't hear back from a company to which I applied.

I learned much during my applying to jobs. I learned the basics of 
Vue trained Object-Oriented JavaScript, learn to correctly 
write code in TypeScript, and generally cemented my knowledge 
from RS School.

I also got one low-paying programming gig, which didn't go well
due to bad communication. And also made one landing site for a 
charity organization so google ads would be more favorable for the organization.
