### The game

Currently, there are nations in the game:
- USA (US navy)
- Japan (IJN - Imperial Japanese navy)
- Third reich/ German -  Krigsmarine
- British - Royal Navy
- Soviet
- Pan Asian
- Italian 
- Pan European

+ additional smaller nations with single ships

There are a couple of types of ships
- submarine
- destroyer
- cruisers which can be distinguished depending on the gun caliber
    a) light cruiser
    b) heavy cruisers
    c) battlecruiser
- battleships
- cruisers

Some nations have 1 or 2 types of ships, and others have more of them. The game tries to be balanced. That means none of the ship's branches should be distinctly better than the other. 

The easiest for new players are battleships. I would recommend a starting player to choose from them. The most forgiving are german ones.

Besides battleships, you also may try the Japanese destroyer line, which leads to shimakaze. 

Other ship branches may be harder. But still, on lower tiers, it shouldn't play a bigger role. The distinctions between ships get substantial with the higher-tier ships.

There are two popular battle types:
- random - 12/12 games (most often) - a team of random players fights another one
- ranking - 7/7 game - you advance in ranks with each win and fall when you lose. There are three leagues: bronze, silver, and gold. After enough wins, you advance to the higher one.
- there are other types of battles, which are not so popular. They can be entertaining to get in the game.

### My battle history

I started playing World of Warships when it was in closed beta. I bought a package with tier VII USN Destroyer Sims, which gave me access to the closed beta. 

I was eager to see the game since I was an experienced World of Tanks player. I heard interesting commentary on the Wows from Youtuber Mighty Jingles. 
The game was very different from what you can see today:
- graphics weren't so pretty,
- minimalized games took as many computer resources as while in battle.
- there were only two nations(Japan and the USA) and three types of ships (destroyer, cruiser, and battleships).
- aiming wasn't broken, as now is. 

There were some bumps in the developer's downfalls, and the game sometimes wasn't joyful. For example:
- when they introduced carriers
 -when they rebalanced to fly a single wing at a time. But it ended up ok in the end. 

I played over 10 000 random battles and around 2000 ranked. I grind all the lines, most of which I already obtained tier X. I have some of the special Tier Xs. Better earning Missouri is also in my Port, so I have no problems economy of silver.

### The game

Currently, it is quite polished. Developers constantly add changes, that have a major influence on the game. I think the game is far away from its 1.0 version.

If you like to play video games, then this title should give you many hours of entertainment. I'm playing World of Warships daily.
