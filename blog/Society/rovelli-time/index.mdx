"Order in Time" was a captivating read. It's short. Have only 200 pages, and each of them contains little text. That allowed me to concentrate on the text and take a while to understand better what I've read.

Carlo Rovelli is an Italian theoretical physicist and writer. He works mainly in the field of quantum gravity. He is the founder of loop quantum gravity theory(which postulates that the structure of space and time is composed of finite loops woven into an extremely fine fabric or network). He also worked with history and philosophy of science. He credits his interest in theoretical physics to LSD.

The first thing which comes to my mind is the similarity with Stephen Hawking's "Brief history of time". Rovelli's book also has this easy essayistic nature, is about time, and both are quite compact. 

The meaning of the word "order" can be interpreted in many different ways. And so does the book shows the time, not only in linear order but in many aspects and different ways. 

Physic side of the time is one of many that shows us Rovelli. He shows us how time is interpreted in Newtonian and Einsteinian Physics. But also cites philosophers (Aristotle, Husserl, Heidegger). Shows a religious point of view on time( saint Augustin, eastern religions). And often turns to Marcels Proust's opus magnum "In Search of Lost Time".

The Order of Time is a book worth the time. It should be especially interesting for those who like science as well as arts. It's written in essayistic and interdisciplinary form, which should be pleasant for the reader.
