### Servings:1

All of the recipes I read cook apples and oatmeal in a pot. I haven't done oatmeal this way. It seems to overcomplicate the recipe. Also, cooked things are less healthy than raw ones. 

I proudly present the best, the healthiest, and the most simple recipe for oatmeal with apple and cinnamon.


### Ingredients:
- half of  an apple, sliced
- half a cup(125g) of oat flakes 
- 1 cup of warm water
- 1/2 teaspoon(2,5g) of cinnamon

### Method:
1. Put it all together. Stir a couple of times and enjoy your breakfast :)
