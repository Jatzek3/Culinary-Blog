"- Knock, knock. 
 - Whos there?
 - It's the police maam. Your son have been hit by a drunk driver. His dead.
 - No, no, no. You can't joke about that[...].
 - You decide whats right or wrong. The same way you decide whats funny or not"


### Introduction

Joker is very rich in detail movie with fenomenal (pokaz) skill of title role actor Joaquin Phenix. He is one of my favourite actor so I was more then just happy to see him in this movie. He add a lot of value to this very deep movie.

Movie itself have many different threads that we uncover or they develop over time. There are a lot of questions and a lot of social problems touched in this film, as I will try to (opisaÄ‡) in my review. First part is brief description of the movie, where many important events are outlined.

Im sure that there can be much more to the film then I wrote, but I belive that if you enjoyed it you can take from the review some interesting thoutghs.


### "I hope my death will make more cents than my life"

Arthur Fleck works as clown. He is sad person who obey social rules, dresses as clown and acts as a happpy person but indeed he is suffering. He felt better in mental clinic than in society. 

He can relate to kids, but when it comes to adult relations he have problems which he rresolves with compulsive laughter. But you can doubt that his laugh is authenthintic, and It could be a way to get out of troublesome social situations. 

Arthur Fantasize about his role model Murray, Who is a father figure for him. "The Lights, The show, the audience, all that stuff, I would give up in a hartbeat to have a kid like You" - Murray says to him in his fantasies. We can see that he don't have a typical border of whats real and whats is his imagination. His beliefs are sometime more real for him then the reality.

Hero experiences couple of severe tramatic events in short time.


### "People expect you to behave as if you D@NT"

Arthur craetes an imaginary relationship with one of his neighbour, when she shows him a litle attention.

Kills 3 jocks that are bullying young women in the subway. Then He dances with cleansing calm music in background. Experiences tranquility. He see that his murders grant him the time in the media, and attention he strived for.

Loose his social services support, and get to know, that in higher class no one care about the simple people.

At his first appearence on stage, though interrupted, with his compulsive loughter, gets him in great mood, and he feels appriciated.


### "I though my Life was a tragedy, but now I realized It's a comedy"

Arthur learns from his mothers letter to him he thinks he is the son of Thomas Wyane. Decide to go to Wayne residence, where he meets young Bruce wayne, whoi later will become Batman, and give put on a happy face on him.

Murray shows his performing tape on his show and make fun of him. Muraay welcomes him to show - to presumably make laugh of him.

Visits his neighbour, which dont recognise him, and his only positive relation appear to be delusions

### "My life is nothing but a comedy"

This is a period, when Arthur develops philosophy to fight back against the unjust oppersion and social system. He takes revenge on people who harmed him, and arbitraryly punish people who took or trying to take advantage of him.

Arthur accepts his joker authenthic personality and is truly happy. As a new person don't have any romorse to kill bullies or people who oppress the weak. Everytime he kills he feel relieved.

Joker becomes his true self just before entering the Scene o Murray show.

- "Comedy is subjective muray. Isnt is that what they say"
- "All of you decide what right or wrong, the same way. Whats funny or not"
- "Why all these people are upset about these guys(...) If it was me dyning on the sidewalk you would pass over me"


### Couple of happy Thoughts


### Everything happens in his head

There are some good indicator that Arthur was locked in hospital for the whole movie
It could all happen in Arthur head in hospital.
- Social worker who is shown in the begining of th movie resembles psychiatrist at the end of the movie, and Arthur have dark hair instead of light brown in the movie.
- in the begging of a movie.  His shown in hospital mental hospital, as in the last scene of the movie. "Do you know why you was locked in the hospital?" Social worker asks him at the start.
- Television gives him material to tell the story of his life in his head. He could imagine hi whole action from the information from the TV
  - The killings of 3 young man - made by some random guy dresed as a clown
  - Thomas Wayne - who is standing for 3 jocks killed by the clown 
  - Identify himself as "the carnival" - his stage name, which he heard also in the radio"
  - He in the murray show
- He has imaginary meetings with his neghbour 
- he has to many bullets for a 6shoot revolver to make all the killings. He run out of ammo after subway killings.
- Hospital allways appears when he meets with psychiatrist or social worker.
- "For my whole life i didnt knew a really existed, but I do" - to social worker when he thinks he is being reconized in the TV

### Thomas Wayne is really Arthur Fleck Father

 Thomas wayne is really jokers father. Penny was working for him and she was atractive woman. Penny wasn't the best mother to Arthur as one of her partners abused him(possibly Thomas Wayne). Penny tells Artur that they made her sign some papers (Probably adoption documents)
- Arthur Has a young Penny photo signed - "Love your smile T. W." - When he is doing making make up for Muray Show. And and he throw it to trash (after killing her)
- As Penny writes to Tomhas Wayn she tought artur to respond happily to negative situation. She trained Arthur to act happily in stresfull and upleasant situations.

### Comedy is subjective murrray - differnet ways to make people laugh

Different sources of goiving laughter to people
- being a victim of violence
- being an object of joke to laugh - from murray
- being a clown - from making a fool of yourself
- being a standuper/ comedian - when people laugh from your jokes - Arthur want to be in this role but he is constnly trated as a victim.
- So he becomes a Joker - who create subjective comedy where he is the person with power.

### A movie about attention

Arthur lacks attention this movie is all about this abadonment of people mentally ill. Instead of caring people make fun of and osticize people who need attention
- Thomas wayne - "maybe a little attention, maybe a hug dad", "shes crazy"
- Murray - when he make laugh of him and invite him to his show
- Social Worker - when she doesent pay attention, and says that society abandoened him
- His mother - never pays attention to him, and doesen't know that "he never felt happy in his life"
- his co worker - when he gives him gun.

Arthur feel really good when, he can make people laugh, and notice him.
- In murray show - "What do you get, when you cross a loner, with a mentall illenss when society abodened him" "You get what you, f.....g, deserve"
- In the stand up show
- when he fantasize about his neighbour
- at the end of the movie when he dances on the top of the mask of a car.

#### Penny had a lobotomy
- You can see when Arthur read his mother files, a line that says "She had a lobot.."
It would explain her emotionless behaviour, thought it stand in contrast to her exageratetd reaction when cops are asking for Arthur.

#### Arthur often can controll his loughter
- In scenes when Arthur meet cops or exits staffroom to meet his employer he can stop loughing or controll his laugh
- He learns what funny and whats not from standup shows - his reception of the shows seems very unauthenthic and he have to take notes, what good joke consits of

From the story we can conlude, Penny tried to make Arthur happy. If she had lobotomy it would be hard to tell for her who are in good mood and who is in bad mood beside some obvious signs, like smile or laugh.

Penny trained then Arthur to show signs of being happy, becouse she couldnt unerstand it otherwise, and she really wanted him to be happy. It is difficult to say if she hit him or it was her partner, presumably Thomas Wayne. 

Penny doesnt't respond well to agression, so I think, that Penny had't beat Arthur, and when she moved out of Wayne residence she was trying to teacg gentlesly Arthur to respond positively to abuse and agression from her partner/partners.

And Penny put a lot of attention that her son would act happy, so much that he learned to respond with laughter or smile to very unfavourable situation. And then it can be argued that his sickness don't cause his laugh. He can even be mentally healthy, with just personality disorders (what explains why the medicine dont work for him. And he take it "not to feel bad", while he is just suffer very much)

Arthur indeed cannot control his laughter most of the times, but when he become Joker, he loughes only when he wants. Not like Arthur who really cannot control his nervous loughter.

#### Arthur wanted to commit suicide on Television

He imagined to shoot himself to the head on Murray show when he was practicing for the show. Before the show he also pulled a gun on his head.

But when he read "I hope my death will make more cents than my life" in his diary he understood that from his suicide would profit Murray. And since he made lough of him, Arthur wouldn't want that. So he understood that Murray should be punished from treating him, disabled person as victim and take profit for this.

#### Its 1986 in the movie

The police cars are rather from 70. The movie, Modern Times by Charlie Chaplin, witch Thomas Wayne watches before meeting with Arthur is from late 30. And the Joker as a DC hero was created in 70 (I think). The music also indicates early 70. Black and white television is also rather from around  60'-80'. 

But when Arthur go to the street after his stand up at pogo's he see a newspaper frontpage with "latest news on the murders" and clown face, there is beneth it "exclusive - photos of distaster in the Ukraine", which almost certainly refers to disaster in Chernobyl which happend in 1986.

#### Arthur want to help society, Joker doesent

"I was broght to this dark world to spread joy and loughter"

When Arthur found out what happened whith him, through his mothers files in Arkham Asylum he understood that all the things he was brought up was a bunch of hypocritical lies. Therfore he REALLY didnt want participate in this mascarade.


### Symbolism and curiosities

1. Id(Conciosu Artur), Ego(Joker), SuperEgo(social rules and his trained laugh) - Joker starts to be himself when he abandon social rules, and starts acting how "he want and feel about people"

2. His mother represents, self control and obeying the rules of society(Superego). She was a person closest to him, but lied and made him suffer. She represent the hipocricy and the harm which social rules couse to the disabled and poor people.

3. Murrays show always on when on his mother is present - represatation of father figure

4. Wayne is the face of the oppresive social system and hypocrisy.

5. Rats, and facade social rules symbolizes the sickness in which the society is functioning. When joker goes on the killing spree, the social rules are thrown out and the riots opposing the social hierarchy start to rise.

6. Stairs are the representation of struggle. Arthur climb heavilly upwards in the begiing of the movie, and as Joker he dances down from them happily.

11. Tv screens are allways something of the second or third person.

7. Television, shows and acting represent the imaginary world in which he exist the more insane he gets. In this world everthing is exagerated and don't have to obey to social rules.

8. In the scene where bruce meets Arthur there are wearing the same color clothes.

9. Movie is split in two parts. First part is when Arthur is chasing kids, and got beaten by them and struggles to climb the stairs. The second is when when Joker dances of the stairs and the detectives who are chasing him are beaten by the cromd.

10. There is somethin about him smoking ;)

12. Arthur with his mother have one bedroom with TV, and one saloon with TV. Both Tv are black and white, but the color television existed from long, long time.

13. Murray knew he has mental problems, and this didn't stop him to make fun of him
  - Does he has a sexual problems? - doctor Sally
  - He looks liek he has a lot of problems - Murray

14. Randal (fat guy who gave gun to Arthur) possibly is homosexual 
  - "You know you are my boy" - when he gives gun to Arthur at the beginning of the the movie
  - "Youre my boy" - before joker kills him

15. In the beginning of the movie Arthur,, as a clown has a little hat, which isnt stolen from him by the bullying kids. Later he doesents haw this hat.

16. Its quite obvious for avarage American that Gotham and Arkham is a analogy for New York.

17. There is a garbage strike, and it isnt taken from the streets.


### Summary

There is certainly more to the movie then this. The soundtrack playing with colour and lights. Currently I don't have access to the internet and I have only Joker and one ther movie to watch, so I watch joker on daily bassis, and Im happy that there is much to this movie.

I would recomend this movie to anyone, not everyony will like this dark sense of humor and some dark topics. the plott isn't also the simplest so the movie is worth more when you watch it more then one time.

If youlike dark psychological movies you will love this movie. Besied this i think its a masterpiece and everyone who watched many movies should enjoy it. Otherwise, you are probably mentally healthy, and it maybe not your first joice.
