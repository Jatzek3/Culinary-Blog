### Introduction

The last episode of the Rings of Power has recently been aired. And I gladly binged on It for over 8 hours, over two weekend days. Most Science Fiction or Fantasy created after Empire Strikes back gets bad reviews. And in this case, as with most, we have the case of failed expectation. This is due to the comparison of newly created movies to our nostalgic and superlative memories from the past.
It is hard to look good when compared to the best moderns work of art. It is more difficult when these works are idealized. Season I of Rings of Power is fun engaging and worth watching.


### Pros of the Rings of Power

#### Tolkien Realm

The biggest advantage of the show is the presence and faithfulness to Tolkiens Universe. I appreciate the world created by Token. During my youth, I read Silmarillion, Hobbit, and Lord of the rings (which I've read a couple of times). Later I was very glad to see the LOTR movie and as much disappointed with the Hobbit movie.  I am positively surprised that the creators didn't crush the world written by Tolkien. They made more than a couple of creative auditions. Have some chronological inconsistencies. But most additions expand the original Tolkien universe.

#### Beuty

The show is visually pleasing. The sceneries are beautiful and well-polished. It's hard to say a bad word about that. Even if the sceneries do not always go in pair with logic.

#### Characters
 Some characters are well-written. While watching the series, you start liking them more and more with every episode. For me, it was Durin and Halbert. 



### Cons of the Rings of Power

Unfortunately, the show has major flaws, which I was lucky to diminish while watching

#### Eleven men

I was displayed with the portayal of elvish man. Celebrimbor, Elrond and Gil-galad. Instead of being depicted as fearless, wis men was shown as indecisive and fragile. I started to like antypathic Elrond from Lord of the ring after watching The Rings of Power. In rings of power he's shown as an incompetent diplomat. If the screenwriters wouldnt help him, he wouldn't know what to say.


#### Political correctedness.
Galadreil and Arondir the woke elf, were the only masculine elfs in the show. Both didn't have best written dialog lines. And both were unlikable unfortunatelly. Amazon wanted to create this politacly correct series and instead he only fuelly the opposite beetwen the people. Yes Tolkien created Middlearth which wa diverse and multiracial, but he did far better. There was no reason of making Caladriel so masculine and unlikable, as there was no reason to add black, where it was inapropriate. There is women masculinity in Lord of the rings, and the the how hobbit and Lord of the ring is about showing how fragile and simple people can influence the tides of biggest wars. We dont need to place rainbow flags everywhere.

#### Fightscense and Dialogues
I will say only that Skyrim did better job with dialogs and fightscenes. 

#### Harfoots

A lot of time was given to Harfoots. Totally needlessly, shows give them to much space. Just as Lord of the RIngs and Hobbit didn't (rozlwekali) on them too much. Maybe the creators of the show should go the same way. I dont imagine how Harfoot advantures could be appealing to the screenwriters, and even if in future seasons they will have bigger impact on the lore, In this seanson it was simpy unreasonable, boring and ofplot. There is a really good reasonn why Tolkien never wrote about Shire too much.

### Summary

The series has it flaws, yet still thanks to the budget, beauty of landscapes, its place in the Tolkien universe I find it woth too watch and fun. Its a big production so even If you are not a fan of Tolkien it can be entartaining for you, but not neccessarly. There are worser things to watch, there are better
