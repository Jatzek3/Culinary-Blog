Thanks to learning Python intensively before, I felt pretty well
about it. I started to learn Django, in pursuit
of getting a junior backend position.

I created a project which was summarizing my learning of Python and Django.
It was very hard to deploy, and some backend parts, like
linking mail, working with the database was extremely hard
for me at the time. I succeeded nevertheless, though
this project could have more functionalities.

Next, I started to mentor pro bono people in Python on 
Facebook. I was looking for some freelancing gigs and applying for full-time jobs.

I started to learn about Computer Science and Software Engineering from different sources.
