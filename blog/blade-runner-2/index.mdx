In this review, I wanted to concentrate on three problems which movie 
depicts. 
1. Imagination and romantic relations
2. Identity as an image of ourselves and others.
3. Counciosness and memories

Blade runner 2049 begins with very well directed scene, where two android
meet and one eliminates the other. Even though they both are not human, and
human etiquete shouldn't aply to them they still are very polite to each other.
The second thing is that they both understand the meaning of the meeting 
and how it will proceed and still are unbelivably nice to each other. 

This is nice depiction of human relation and behaviour, even when you are
in drastically bad situation you are still expected to play some kind of role. 
Or if you are in a position of power and are to for example fire someone, you
still need respect the rules of day to day politeness. No one should say that, 
the king is naked.

On the other hand there is a situation, where one android thinks of his 
executioner as being of one kind with other and executioner distance himself
setting the border and saying that they are not the same. It is a millenia
old topic in every culture of who we perceive to be akeen to each other. And it
is used by politician or ideologists to justify theyre goals. (For example in Nazi
Germany Jews was not only portayed as people of worser sort but even "insectized").
