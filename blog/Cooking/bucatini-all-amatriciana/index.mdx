### Servings: 2

Every recipe for this simple pasta will tell you that it's named after the Italian village Amatrice near Rome. So I put it here not to be too original.

You can read many things about this simple dish, that it is unnecessary. But content creators have to do their jobs, and will input many useless details that can potentially spoil this pasta.

It's not the original recipe. But you can be quite sure, that they will serve you worse Spaghetti All'Amatricania in your favorite restaurant. 


### Ingredients:

- a tablespoon of canola/vegetable oil - no reason to use olive oil.
- 100g of bacon cut in 1cm cubes - should be 'guanciale', but bacon works well for me.
- 0,5 can of tomatoes. Squash them with a fork or hand, so they become like sauce. You should use canned tomatoes, not fresh ones.
- 200 grams of bucatini pasta - Spaghetti, Spaghettone, and Tagliatelle will also work fine. Other types of pasta won't spoil the dish.
- (optionally) 1 tablespoon of white vinegar - This is to replace the white wine. In the recipes, I saw 100ml of white wine added for acidity. You can skip this part, and the dish will be at least as good.
- (optionally) 50 grams of grated cheese - You can use the Italian dry ones. It's more traditional. I like gouda.

### Method:

1. Heat the pan with a tablespoon of oil to medium heat.
2. Fry the bacon on the pan until the fat renders and the bacon will start to brown
(Optional) Add a tablespoon of vinegar/Add white wine and wait for it to reduce.
3. Make al dente pasta in a separate pot. Don't drain all the pasta water 
4. Add squashed tomatoes to the pan with bacon. Cook for 5min.
5. Check the taste.
(optionally) You can add some pasta water(1-3 tablespoons preferably). You can add spices, salt, pepper, or even some MSG. But the ingredients should have enough taste.
6. If you have a big enough pan, add al dente pasta to the sauce. If you don't, add the sauce to the drained pasta in the pot. Cook on low for 2-3 minutes.
(Optional). (Sprinkle with cheese before serving)
7. Buon Appetito :)
