### Servings:2

I've always been curious about pad thai. Lately, I had the occasion 
to try it. I had some restrictions regarding the execution of the dish, but 
I didn't have them about the dish itself.

I now have a crush on pad thai, and try to create it in a tasty and reasonably cheap way. It is a very satisfying and exciting endeavor. It is difficult to spoil this dish, and yet in taste is very rich and complex.


### Ingredients:
- 1 medium-sized onion/ 1 shallot- cut into long strips/sliced
- 3 garlic cloves -  finely sliced 
- 1/2 of carrot - finely slice
- 200mg or red beans 
- 200grams of broad rice noodles /tagliatelle
- 3 eggs
- 3 tablespoons of peanuts (or other nuts) - crushed into smaller pieces (i crush them with a cup, mortar is probably handier)
- canola oil

### Sauce
- 3 tablespoons(50 g) fish sauce
- 3 tablespoons(50g) of brown sugar / sugar
- 1 Tablespoon of rice vinegar
- 3 grated pepperoncino/ 1 tablespoon(15g) of red pepper flakes
- juice from 1/2 lime or lemon
- 1 tablespoon(15g) of tomato puree
- 3 Tablespoon(50g) of soy sauce / sriracha sauce

### Method:

1. If you have wok and rice noodles, it will be much easier for you to make the dish. I'll describe the dish as I make it in a pan and spaghetti.
2. Cook the spoaghetti al dente in a pot. It is important since it will have to drain the water from the sauce.
3. Set a pan with canola oil(or similar oil with a high smoke point. Don't use olive oil) on medium heat. Add finely sliced carrot.
4. At this moment, you have some time to make the sauce. Put all sauce ingredients in a jar, close it and give it a few solid shakes
5. After about seven minutes, add garlic and onion.
6. After the next five minutes, set aside all the ingredients on one side, and leave space on the other side. Knock the eggs on the empty side and give a stir from time to time till it stiffens. 
7. Add half of the peanuts and red beans to the rest of the ingredients on the pan. Mix everything a couple of times. 
8. Add the contents of the pan to noodles. Add the sauce, and place everything on low heat. Mix for a while until the sauce will get absorbed.

Enjoy!
 


### Footnotes:

- It's a good idea to add some protein to the dish, for example, tofu/chicken. It tastes good with shrimps.
- Carrot is optional, but a good addition. Feel free to skip it.
- You can replace soy sauce with Maggi.
- Usually, rice noodles are accompanied by bamboo sprouts. If you don't have them feel free to skip them. I personally don't use them.
- I created a mixture for a sauce without tamarind paste or Worcestershire sauce. You can try to create a sauce with them if you have them.
