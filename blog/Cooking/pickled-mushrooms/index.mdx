In Poland, in late summer and early fall, the mushrooms grow fast. Mushrooms grow all year, but every mushroom type has its growing season. Most of them in Poland have it in September and November.

### Ingredients:

- 2kg of raw mushrooms

### Marinate

- 2 onions sliced
- 4 cups of water
- 1 tablespoon of mustard seeds
- 2 tablespoons of sugar
- 2 tablespoons of salt
- 4 bay leafs
- 8 allspice berries
- 8 pepper berries


- 1 cup of white vinegar 10%

### Method:

1. Scald out the jar and jar lids in boiling water
2. Add one tablespoon of salt to the pot of boiling water
3. Boil all the mushrooms in a Pot full of boiling water for 10 min
4. Distribute the mushrooms between the jars
5. Cook all the ingredients(important - without the vinegar) for the marinate for about 20 minutes.
6. Turn the heat off. Pour the vinegar into the pot and stir a couple of times.
7. Add still very warm marinate to the jars with mushrooms. A ladle is a good tool for it.
8. Close all the jars as tight as you can. You can use a towel or cloth not to burn yourself.
9. Put all the jar's lids down for 30 minutes.
10. Check if all the jars are now hermetically closed by looking at the lid. If it is concave, it's closed well
11. If it is still convex, you need to pasteurize it. 
11. Dry pasteurization = 30min in the oven at 130 degrees Celsius - then put the jars, lid down, for 30 min to cool down.
