I did not yet write any zombie-apocalypse novel. I hadn't written any novel till now and don't plan it for the nearest future. After watching lots of movies and series, some about zombies, I developed some preferences about them. I'm sure that everybody has their favorite movie genre or topic in the series.

But this review won't be about zombies, horror, or post-apocalyptic movies. It will be about the process of creating the world, heroes, and environment. Which is appropriate to any kind of work of art, where the plot develops over time. Why the zombie apocalypse 
is such a comfortable time for starting point of the plot?

### World

When you start writing your story, you will probably choose the time of action in the nearest future. That will give you access to the whole world created by humanity, without hard-to-research topics, like folklore, mentality, religion, or social circles. You get the whole world created from the start on google maps.

If you've decided on starting point in the nearest future, you can add or remove some troublesome obstacles in the environment. It is in the future, so if you want to place a large hospital in a town of ten thousand people, then go ahead. But think about it, is it a good idea to mix real and imaginary places? Where are the boundaries?

You can place the action of your script in the whole world. There are many vehicles left around with full tanks. Heroes can easily change scenery. Zombie-apocalypse scenarios often have a road and exploration narrative. That gives some potential for changing the pace of the plot. 

Heroes will want to communicate with other people. There won't be modern communication on the internet or mobile phones. Radios, walkie-talkies, light signals, or sound signals will still work. There could be some mechanism for Zombies to communicate, like bees. Some people can learn the patterns and communicate with other survivors.

The time of organized religion has ended. Humanity has been set back to the middle ages. There will be a massive amount of new religions. Some of them will stick to their pre-apocalyptic character. But many will grow of necessity in ways that stray from today's beliefs.

Similar to religion also today's currency will lose its value. In a short amount of time, people will trade gold and silver. 

### Heroes

When creating the main characters for your story, you have a lot of place for choices. Zombie apocalypse allows you to choose from any person in the whole world. The average social barriers do not apply.
In the group, you can have an owner of the largest factory in town, an engineer working for the competition, and a worker who is also an active member of a labor union. They all can be in the same group of survivors and have no reason to argue. The apocalypse changed the traditional 
social hierarchy. Now charismatic worker, who is also very handy, can be the leader. While the owner could be a slave who hopes to get food the next day.

Most specialized professions lose their meaning in the post-apocalyptic world. Old blue-collar jobs gain on value. Even if the job isn't practical, the strength gives an advantage, to people who worked with their hands. Doctors would be in high demand, and there could be wars between the clans for them. New professions could evolve or return from the past.
 
You can simply add new heroes as the plot develops. The whole world is full of survivors and surviving groups. You can ally with another group. Trade or exchange for a member of your opponent team. There is no limitation on how your group will expand.


Work in progress
