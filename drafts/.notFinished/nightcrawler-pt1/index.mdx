Nightcrawler is truly magnificent movie, in which every dialog has its 
meaning, every scene has its place, and camera moves let us closer participate
in every scene.

Even though role of main character is shallow, and his actions are predictable
his interactions with other people gave me couple of perspectives on which it can 
interpreted.

1. Main charachter as personification of relations beetween institutions and people
2. Main character as a dipitction of people aspiring to middle class
3. Main chaaracter as a hyperbole of transatcion-like human relations
