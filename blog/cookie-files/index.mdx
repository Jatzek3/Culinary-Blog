You might be wondering where the browser keeps information.
There are three methods where they are stored:
*Cookies
*Local Storage
*Session Storage

Cookies are small messages(4kb), which the website sends to you your browser and then it is saved until it expires (or the browser window is closed
if the expiry date isn't passed in the cookie. Storing information in
cookies is relative if they are encrypted. But still, even encrypted
information can get into the wrong hands, and be used in malicious ways, 
so there shouldn't be any critical unsecured data in cookies like passwords
or credit card numbers.

Local Storage is a Javascript object which is placed in the browser, it
has 5MB of capacity. It is very easy to enter from the developer's point of view and allows for getting by without accessing the backend. Since it is
a Javascript object can be easily entered and injected with malicious 
code. According to the author of the article, there is a massive amount of 
tutorials, materials which teach storing Jason Web Tokens(JWT - a sample of
code which identifies a person entering from the browser) in Local Storage
What is very insecure and you should never store sensitive information in
local storage, especially JWT.

Local storage is good for information that:
*Is not at all sensitive
*Doesn’t need to be used in an ultra high-performance app
*Isn’t larger than 5MB
*Consists of purely string data

Session Storage

Session Storage is similar to Local Storage(it also has 5MB), but it expires at
the end of the session, which doesn't make it that much safer
since your information can be stolen while using the unsecured website.
