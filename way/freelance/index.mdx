At the end of RS School, I started applying for jobs. With React and Redux quite well studied, whole basic knowledge of 
backend and some computer science, feeling quite well with HTML, CSS, and JS I felt optimistic about my chances.

RS school was extended with Angular tasks; In which I decided
to participate. For a whole month, I studied the structure of the Angular framework. It is difficult to get a grip on it, but when
you will wrap your mind around it, the structure of Angular becomes meaningful. It is well suited for larger applications.


I learned much during the time I was applying to jobs. I've learned the basics of Vue trained Object-Oriented JavaScript, learned to write code in TypeScript, and generally cemented my knowledge 
from RS School.

I got one low-paying programming gig, made one landing site for a charity organization so google ads would be more favorable for the organization.
