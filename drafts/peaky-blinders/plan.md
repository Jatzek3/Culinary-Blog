### Introduction

-Did you ever wanted to travel back in time....?
-> Peaky blinders show on screen how this reality would look and it isn't nice

Thankfully we dont have to live in interwar Birmingham.
Where Peaky blinders are taking us for whole six seasons.

We can happily watch the peripeteia of the heroes in our home. Far away from the dangers of early XX century industrail town. Which is shown remarkably well. Both from historical point of view, as for plot Peaky Blinders are filmed remarkably. 


- Tom Shelby - very good role, I like him very much
- Worthy of pointing out Arthur Shelby, littlefinger and the jew +

The series have been, received overpassing any expectation. So well that there people started giving heroes names to thier children. So there would be more Tommys, Arthurs and Adas since the serieas was aired.

#### The world 

Tom Shelby is the head of a gang of peaky blinders. 
They have the name from using razors to cut their enemies forhead, so the blood will flow on the eyes and blind themn. The series series of engaments beetween the gang and other gangs, the United Kingdom, ethinc minorities and other diffrent parties. Tom is not alone in his endeavors, and most often can count on support of his families and allies. 

The show is quite accurate historically and most of the groups have existed as well as the Peaky Blinders. THere is quite a big attention to detail in that matter, so even the cloathes of Peaky Blinders has been adjusted to the orignals. 

The world is believable, and looks simmilar to what you could expect from this period of time in England. The plot though is entirely make up and facts are  often in service of the story. Historical events have miningfull impact, but the story isn't driven by them.
