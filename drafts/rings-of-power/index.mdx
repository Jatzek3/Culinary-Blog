### Introduction

The last episode of the Rings of Power has recently been released. I gladly binged on it for over eight hours. Most Science Fiction or Fantasy created after the "Empire Strikes Back" gets negative reviews. In this case, as with most, we have the case of failed expectations. I think it's due to the comparison, of newly created movies to our nostalgic and superlative memories from the past.
It is hard to look well when compared to the best moderns work of art. It's even harder when these works are idealized. Season I of Rings of Power is fun, engaging, and worth watching.


### Pros of the Rings of Power

#### Tolkien Realm

The biggest advantage of the show is the presence and faithfulness to Tolkiens Universe. I appreciate the world created by Token. In my youth, I read Silmarillion, Hobbit, and Lord of the Rings (which I've read a couple of times). Later, I was overjoyed to see the LOTR movie and similarly disappointed with the Hobbit movie. 
I'm positively surprised that the creators didn't crush the world written by Tolkien. They made more than a couple of creative auditions. Rings of Power have some chronological inconsistencies. But most additions expand the original Tolkien universe.

#### Beuty

The show is visually pleasing. The sceneries are beautiful and well-polished. It's hard to say a bad word about that. Even if the show does not always go in pair with logic.

#### Characters

Some characters are well-written. While watching the series, I started liking them more and more with every episode. It was Durin and Halbert, for me. 



### Cons of the Rings of Power

Unfortunately, the show has major flaws, which I was lucky to diminish while watching.

#### Eleven men

I was displeased with the portrayal of elvish men. Celebrimbor, Elrond and Gil-galad. Instead of being depicted as fearless, wise men, they were shown as indecisive and fragile. I even started to like the antipathic Elrond from Lord of the Rings, after watching The Rings of Power.
 In rings of power, he's shown as an incompetent diplomat. If the screenwriters wouldn't help him, he wouldn't know what to say.


#### Political correctness.

Galadriel and Arondir, the woke elf, were the only masculine elves in the show. They both didn't have the best-written dialog lines, and both were unlikeable. Amazon wanted to create this politically correct series.
Instead, he only fueled the opposites between people. Tolkien created Middle-earth, which was diverse and multiracial. But he did this far better. There was no reason of making Caladriel so masculine and antipathic. There was no reason to add a black person, where it was inappropriate. 
There are masculine women in Lord of the Rings.

Hobbit and Lord of the Rings are about fragile and simple people who can influence the tides of the biggest wars. There's no reason to place rainbow flags everywhere.

#### Fightscense and Dialogues

Skyrim did a better job with dialogs and fight scenes. And Skyrim is a video game that is ten years old.

#### Harfoots

A lot of screen time was given to Harfoots. Totally senseless. There is a reason why Lord of the Rings and Hobbit didn't give the Shire too much space. Maybe the creators of the show should go the same way. I don't imagine how Harfoot adventures could be appealing to anyone. If in future seasons, they will have a bigger impact on the lore, then maybe such boring and logically crippled stories could have meaning. In this season, it was unreasonable, boring, and of the plot. 

### Summary

The series has its flaws. Thanks to the budget, the beauty of landscapes, and its place in the Tolkien universe, I find it worth watching and fun. It's a big production, so even If you are not a fan of Tolkien it can be entertaining for you. There are worse things to watch, and there are better ones.
