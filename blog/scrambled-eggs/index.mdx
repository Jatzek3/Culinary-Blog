Most recipes I've seen use butter and milk. You are 
missing much, if you only try this variant of the dish and I 
suggest You try this one:

Ingredients:

- A tbsp of lard
- 4 eggs
- a pinch of salt
- 4 slices of bread 

1. Put the lard on a pan on medium heat until it melts.
2. Crack the eggs onto the pan, add some salt
3. Put the bread into the toaster 
4. Stir the eggs from time to time on the pan until they will
have desired consistency.

footnotes:

- If You don't like lard, You can use butter and bacon instead
- I'm not a fan of the uniform texture of scrambled eggs. If you 
prefer them this way, you can whisk the eggs in a bowl before
you will put them on a pan.
