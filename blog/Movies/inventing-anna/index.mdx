Whole series of "Inventing Anna" starts slow. With each episode is gaining tempo. Shonda Rhimes does good work with directing difficult material. From other titles he had created, it's easy to conclude that she directs mainly woman-centered films. The movie's watchability is independent of sex. The subject of the movie isn't though. The series is worth watching.

One big advantage is the impersonation of Anna Sorokin by Julia Garner. She was also one of the leading actors in the Ozark. In both shows, she did a remarkable job. Just to appreciate the difference in both roles, I recommend you watch both shows https://theyellowpages.live/blog/ozark/. In both this petite blond woman does a remarkable job playing wanna-be anglo-german heiress and an entrepreneurial redneck girl who had to take everything into her own hands.

The Story starts when a young couple lands on a luxurious yacht. Thanks to Anna's charisma, they have been successful in the first founding of an application. The story shows, how "fake it until you make it" can backfire. Today's culture of success leads to the propagation of a "scamming culture" in the best-case scenario. In my mind, if someone falls for these values, the worst thing is having it successful. But most people will lose a couple of friends or acquaintances, maybe a little bit of cash.

People fall for these fantasies because they don't accept their social status. Success stories are like the cheese in the mousetrap. Believing and hard work are enough to achieve the dream, a beautiful girlfriend, nice shoes, or an expensive car. My brother told me that he felt confident, only when he achieved a very high monthly income and a stable, respectful job. 

In the end, this is not an article about hustle culture.

I got the impression, that Anna cared more for the expensive clothes than actually being perceived as royalty. She wouldn't cheat on the money people who can introduce her to high-status people.

The story is blunter than it is shown. Propper editing, the addition of the journalist site, and a couple of jumps back and forth in time made the plot interesting. This and good cameras, editing, and Julia Garner, made the series worth watching. Netflix has poured some money into a rather uninteresting story of a scammer and made it worth the consideration. Grotesque and self-referencing.
