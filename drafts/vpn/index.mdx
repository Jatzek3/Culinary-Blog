If you rather read a long article, written by a non-native speaker, then you are very welcome.

### How does it work?

At the start of its existence, VPNs were serving employers to allow remote work for their employees. Through the years it has changed. Today people around the world can use VPNs to choose their entry point to the internet. This is how connecting with VPN works, without technical details.
- Internet - This is where all data is, to which we want to connect
- Virtual Private Network - An institution, which let you choose the entry location to the internet. Companies claim that also the data is encrypted and they don't keep the logs.
- Internet Service Provider - an institution or a person which gives you bandwidth(Mb/s, Gb/s = how fast we download)
- You - a user, who wants to watch British Netflix or doesn't want to disclose your favorite football team :)

If you want to use VPNs for privacy reasons, You really shouldn't use free VPNs. They have to make a living somehow.

### Security

Today Wi-fi connections are secure and use protocols that aren't hackable. This wasn't the case a decade ago when the data could be intercepted without too many Information Technology skills.

Most sites use HTTPS today. If the site can be a security concern you are warned while coming to the website with a huge warning sign and blocking the site. Even if you bypass the warning site, any password or meaningful information won't be automatically leaked.

If security is concerned, most systems today have antivirus and firewall installed. Military-grade encryption which is a buzzword in VPN ads is today used in all browsers with HTTPS

### Privacy

Regarding Privacy, there are some pros to using a commercial VPN.
1. If you are afraid of spying on you by Internet Providers. 
2. If you always wanted to be a pirate, and want to safely make your dream come true.
3. If you live in China, North Korea, Russia, Belarus, or other countries which could be blocking content or spying on you.
4. If You want to use content blocked in your country on specific websites(like Netflix)
5. If Want to be sure that no one will know about your sexuality or things you are browsing.
6. Have some vicious intentions, and want to hide your network activity.
7. You don't want to be in the future recreated by robots in virtual reality to study human behavior


- The points three and four are valid and purchasing yourself a VPN should be the case even in these scenarios
- The points one, two, five, and seven. It makes sense to have VPN, but if privacy is considered, you would feel more secure making your own VPN. You can also use the Tor browser which I consider more private and safe than any VPN.
- If you have some vicious intentions, then really you should search the internet on your Tor browser and search for tips there. 

### Logging

Most VPNs state they are not logging the data. They must keep them tough, so the browsing through them would be fast. Thanks to this you shouldn't wait longer every other time you visit the same site. 

If some of the logs were indeed completely purged, the commercial VPN would become the center of exchanging information for any criminal activity. So VPN isn't enough to avoid a crime. It is more like sprinkling your face with lemon juice to make you invisible to cameras in the bank you are about to rob (you can check on the internet for this story if you haven't heard about it yet).

It can be argued that it indeed helps cath you because your data now go through Internet Service Provider and Virtual Private network, one more entity that could leak your data.

You don't have any information on what the VPN company is doing with your data.

You could stay that if the privacy is compromised VPN would be out of business. But that is not true and I can share some facts for research.
- PureVPN logs were used to arrest Ryan Lin in 2017.
- NordVPN was hacked in 2018 from a remote computer. 
And they both are still in business.

Often if someone doing something socially unacceptable, or breaking the law then they need privacy. Most people just "want privacy" and are not criminals, but it's easier to spot criminal activities in a smaller group of people.

There could be many ways in which obtained data could be used against a customer's will. The most simple is to sell it to the Advertisement Company to screen appropriate ads on certain sites. But there are way more things that can be done with your data than this.

Organizing a cheap and reliable VPN could be a perfect way to gather huge amounts of information on their clients, and you won't know If your VPN is one of them.

### Summary

Many people have their privacy even when going online. Today it is very difficult, most major websites ask for cookies to track the user. And very often it is necessary to accept it before you will see the webpage.
It is also nice to feel that you are secure browsing the Internet and no one is spying on you, your government cannot see what you are browsing.
If VPN gives you a sense of security, it may be worth the money. Otherwise, I wouldn't use it. 

If you are living in a place where there's no freedom of speech, or want to watch the internet from the point of view of a different country, you shouldn't use VPN.

Tor browser is a browser like any other, but lets you use the connection with the internet as secure and private as it can be. If you are considering buying a VPN maybe you should also consider the Tor browser or (for technical people) making your own VPN.
