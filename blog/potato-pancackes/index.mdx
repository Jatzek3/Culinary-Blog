Ingredients:
1kg of peeled potatoes
2 medium-sized onions
2 eggs
1 cup of flour

salt 
black pepper

oil

Recipe:
1. Finely grate potatoes and onions. (If you don't have time use a cup blender instead)
2. Mix in eggs, salt, black pepper, and flour.
3. Heat the pan to high heat, and pour the mixture on the pan (with a cup, for example). When the round of the pancakes will become brownish, turn them to the other side. 
4. When the pancakes will be starting to turn brownish on the sides. Take them off the pan, and check if there is enough oil. Pour some more if not.
5. Repeat steps 3 and 4 until there is no more mixture. You can also save it for later. It will
have a darker color, but it will be good for at least one day.


footnotes:
- I sometimes added smoked paprika to my pancakes. I recommend using only salt and pepper.
- A little MSG never hurts, in my opinion.
- I like eating potato pancakes with greek/dense yogurt.  It's most commonly served with sour cream. Ketchup is also ok.
- You can use lard instead of oil
