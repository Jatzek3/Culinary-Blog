"BEM (Block, Element, Modifier) is a component-based approach 
to web development. The idea behind it is to divide the user
interface into independent blocks. This makes interface development easy and fast even 
with a complex UI, and it allows reuse of existing code without copying and pasting."
                                                    -  BEM documentation

Bem stands for:
- Block - A functionally independent page component that can be reused.
- Element - A composite part of a block that can't be used separately from it.
- Modifier - An entity that defines the appearance, state, or behavior of a block or element.

An element is always part of a block, and you shouldn't use it separately from the block. A modifier can't be used alone.

HTML class naming convention looks like this:
- Block__Element
- Block--Modifier
- Block__Element--modifier

# Example

        <form class="search-form search-form--focused">
            <input class="search-form__input">

            <button class="search-form__button search-form__button--disabled">Search</button>
        </form>


It's a short introduction to BEM methodology. It's commonly adapted in HTML/CSS classes, but can be 
also used in other different fields as file structure naming, XML, or JavaScript. 
If you want to learn more, documentation is a good choice.

It takes some time to get used to it, but it's standard worth learning. There are some drawbacks, and 
flooding HTML with classes never was close to my heart.
