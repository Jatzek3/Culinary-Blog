"The Imperial Eagle which soars in majestic solitude above the earth is a manifestation of the 
Empire's supra-territorial sovereignty. It stands in a posture of display against a golden disc 
representing the Light of Reason, and clasps in its talons an Empyrean Sky Ring  denoting the limitlessness 
of human potential. The full formal name of the Atlantian State occupies an arc above, 
and this is mirrored below by its motto, which translates as "A Light in the Darkness".
