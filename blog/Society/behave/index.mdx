tl;dr "Behave..." is an interdisciplinary popular science book about why we behave in specific ways.

### Introduction

A couple of years ago, while studying MIT lectures on Computer science, I stumbled upon the Roberts Sapolsky lectures. I liked them very much, and you can find them here.

Lectures have less content, and I recommend you read a book. Still, they are humorous and educational. Two months ago, while visiting the library in search of some interesting book, I saw on a small table the title "Behave: The Biology of Humans at Our  Best and Worst" by Robert M. Sapolsky, as if it were waiting specifically for me. (It could be that librarian was reading it, and I "sneaked" it from her ).

From this time, I'm enjoying this funny, interdisciplinary, and educating book on the biological grounds of human behavior. I would recommend it to anyone (Besides illiterate people. I don't want to insult anyone. ;) ). The book itself has the size of two solid bricks, with 900 pages. Colorful illustrations could be added to thje book. The font is a bit small. But the amount of content is enormous, and I doubt that the publisher and author would decide to split the book into parts.


### The author

Robert Sapolsky is an American professor of biology and neurology at Stanford University. He is an author and researcher of neuroendocrinology, a branch of biology that studies the interaction between the nervous and the endocrine system. It reaserchers, for example, how brain activity impacts hormones.

He was born in New York, Brooklyn, in a family of immigrants from the Soviet Union. He was raised as an Orthodox Jew, but describes himself as an Atheist. After receiving a Bachelor of Arts in anthropological biology with "summa cum lauda" from Harvard University. He moved to Kenya to mingle a bit with baboons. When the war broke out in the neighboring country, he went there to see it for his own eyes and continued his trip through Africa, which ended after 1,5 years. After this, he continued visiting baboons in Africa during the summer for 25 years.

### The book

Long story short, "Behave..." is an interdisciplinary popular science book about why we behave in specific ways. 

The author specializes in the biology of nervous systems and hormones. These topics constitute a big part of the book. But even if it is strict biology, it's usually accompanied by a metaphor, a joke, or a study of the behavior.

But there's much more than only biology in the book. On the other hand, it depicts how society can affect our brains and hormones. Testosterone is verbosely described in the book. There are many myths about this hormone. There is this selfish macho cliche that should be emanating testosterone. Studies in the books show how far from the truth this stereotype is. Testosterone secretion happens when a person cooperates with the group. 

This book is full of similar counterintuitive content. The author presents paradigms, theories, studies, and experiments from a wide range of science. I can recall some of them:

- anthropology
- sociobiology 
- evolutionist psychology
- neurobiology
- social psychology
- sociology
- psychology

Sapolsky often decorates more scientific fragments of the books with tales, metaphors, and jokes. Jokes and anecdotess are in the footnotes. Some of them are hilarious. Author gives his lectures with simmilar jokes and stories, that are in the book. If the volume of the book terrifies you, try watching lectures first. Historical events are also part of this book. There are many references to events of the XX century. 

All these arguments from different sources lead to the question of the existence and impact of free will. We can read what Robert Sapolsky thinks on this matter (after watching the lectures, I got a different impression of his view on this topic).

### Summary

"Behave.." is a great position, for everyone curious about human behavior.
