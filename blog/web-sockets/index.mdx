When You are communicating through the internet You are using
an HTTP protocol, which only works one way, and the connection 
is lost after the user will receive a response from the server.

When You open a website, You send a request and receive data, 
which allows you to use this site on your computer. Next time you want to interact with this website you will have to send another
completely new request to the website.

Websockets are an upgrade to HTTP in the sense that the connection between user and server remains open. This means that users don't have to send a request to receive information from the server. In
HTTP it is not an option for a server to communicate with the user 
without an HTTP request.
