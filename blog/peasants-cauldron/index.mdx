One time a mix of spices for a dish named "Gypsy cauldron"
fell into my hands. I liked the dish from the recipe
and thought that it's not that hard to replicate the dish by myself without using the mix of spices. I changed the name from Gypsy to peasant (to be politically correct of course).
The dish is really good, although quite simple, and is not 
"restaurant quality" as Gordon Ramsey would say.

0,5 kg of potatoes
250 mg of sausage
2 middle to large onions
1 bell pepper
5 teaspoons of Tomato puree

Spices: 
1 pinch of cumin
Salt, pepper
1 beef stock cube 
4 allspice balls
2 bay leafs

1. Peel and cut the tomatoes into small pieces (about 2x2x2cm).
Put them in the pot and fill the pot with water so the water covers the potato.

2. Put the pot with potatoes on high heat, when it starts to boil
turn it down to low/medium.

3. Put the Pan with oil (about 3 tbsp) on medium heat.

4. Dice the Onions and put them on the pan.

5. Dice the sausage and put it on the pan with onions. Keep
them on the Pan till the point where onion shrinks, then
add the diced bell pepper to them.

6. Add the Pan mixture to the Potatoes in the pot, and if
the water doesn't covers it, add some hot water, so nothing will
go over the surface level.

7. Add the tomato puree and spices to the pot.

8. After 20-30 minutes of cooking, potatoes should be soft. Check
the taste and season it to get appropriate taste.

Enjoy your meal :)
