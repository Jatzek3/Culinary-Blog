### Servings: 2

1. Ogórki Kiszone are a staple polish side dish. 
2. It is a second pickled dish which I leaned to make. First was Korean Kim-Chi which is pickled cabbage, with paste of hot paprika. It is very tasty traditional Korean dish, but I doubt that every will enjoy its specific taste and smell. I recommend you give it a try in restaurant or make it by yourself. It's a great fun.
3. As with Kimchi I also got quickly hooked by pickling cocumbers. You can really pickle everything tough some vegatables are more suitable for it then others. Now for example I added tomatoes to the cocumbers so I will have a mix half of jars of tomatoes, half of with cocumbers.
