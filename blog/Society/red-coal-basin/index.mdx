Red Coal Basin (in polish Czerwone Zagłęgbie) is name of Zagłęgbie Dąbrowskie
in Poland, which underlines strong connections of this area with the labor movement.

On the verge of the XIX and XX centuries, it was the most industrialized polish region under Russian rule. On the wave of strikes, the short-lived Coal Basin Republic was created.
On the head of the government stood labor party activists. After two weeks 
Russian disarmed independence forces and sent them massively to Syberia.

In the II RP (1918-1939), the influence of the Red Coal Basin on the labor movement was still strong. And its traditions was proudly maintained and remembered during 
PRL (1945- ). I heard that while most of Poland was suffering from food and equipment
shortages, Red Coal Basin had many supplies, and people from this region didn't have
problems with buying food and hadn't to wait in line for basic supplies.
