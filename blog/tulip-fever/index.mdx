A Tulip Fever was first noted example of speculative bubble
in history. It is the more interesting that the object of the
bubble didn't had any rational worth beside its beauty. Tulip bulbs
was traded beetween people which were hobbyst of seeding and trading 
these flowers. There werent many reason to be anxious for long time
but when Tulip traders began using futures contract as a tool
which allow them to sell a bulb which mature later and restricted
the rights to offspring of most valuable bulbs to sertain people
the price quickly started to raise. On this wave of madness people started
buying bulbs for profit and borrowing money to buy them and later
sell them for profits. The boom couldn't last for ever and one day
the buble broke and prices fell down in very sudden way.

This is an outline how speculative bubble may mork. Often the 
mechanism behind price growth is different but cycle is very 
simmilar. This is the background of movie Tulip Fever, in plot of which
the bubble is intervowen. Beside that movie shows very realisticly
scenery of 1636-1637 dutch city. The plot resembles me works
of William Shakespeare, where comedy and tragedy went hand in hand.
Overall very beutifull movie, whith very good roles of experienced 
actors (Christopher Waltz, Judi Dench) and interesting roles of 
Alicia Vikander and Dane DeHaan.
