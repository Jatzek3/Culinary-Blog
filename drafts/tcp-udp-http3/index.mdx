HTTP is in 7 application layer of the OSI(Open System Interconnect)
model. This model help professionals to understand problems and 
conceptualize thoughts. This model have following layers:
- Layer 7 - Application - about this layer of internet connection you can read 
in the above mention HTTP article 
- Layer 6 - Presentation.
- Layer 5 - Session.
- Layer 4 - Transport - This will be main topic of this post.
- Layer 3 - Network.
- Layer 2 - Data Link.
- Layer 1 - Physical.

If you want to read about OSI layer you can read the following article:
