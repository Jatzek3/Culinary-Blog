Recently I read another Carlo Rovelli book and wrote a review.

https://theyellowpages.live/blog/rovelli-time/

Both books are amazing lectures. I had a marvelous time reading them both.

### Author

Carlo Rovelli is an Italian theoretical physicist and writer. He works mainly in the field of quantum gravity. He is the founder of loop quantum gravity theory(which postulates that the structure of space and time is composed of finite loops woven into an extremely fine fabric or network). He also worked with history and philosophy of science. He credits his interest in theoretical physics to LSD.

### The Book

If you hadn't paid attention to physics in high school, watched a couple of documentaries on Internet, and have a vague understanding of physics, then this book is perfect for you. It tells the story of physics from its roots in Antique time till today. The connections between great minds are very distinctly shown. The progress of physics as a science is neatly laid out, and definitely more interesting than any textbook.

This book, in four chapters, tells the story of inventors who made major leaps in physics. From Democritus till today, Stephen Hawking, the author himself, and failure of String Theory.

I  am happy that the String Theory, hasn't been proven at CERN. I am not a mathematician and barely understand the basic physic equation. Yet I always fought about the string theory, as to complex, and adding needles and unprovable dimensions to reality. Even with M-theory, which connected all different parts of String Theory and demanded 11-dimensions to exist. I've never believed in it, though maths could state otherwise. I've also never believed in gravitons, particles that would carry the force of gravity. Unfortunately, I have to have it on faith and common sense, and can't prove it in complex equations.

In the final chapters, there are some mentions about how time behaves near black holes, black hole radiation, and loop gravity. I don't feel very comfortable with them. But besides this, it was a very clear and enjoyable lecture. For people who start their adventure with physics, everything till Newton or Einstein should be a piece of cake. 

### Summary

Do I recommend this book? Of course, and without a doubt.
