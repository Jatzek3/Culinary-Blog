### Introduction

Joker is a very rich-in-detail movie with the phenomenal show of skill of title role actor Joaquin Phenix. He is one of my favorite actors, so I was more than just happy to see him in this movie. He adds a lot of value to this deep movie.

I'm sure that there can be much more to the film than I wrote, but I believe that if you enjoyed the movie, you can take from the review some interesting thoughts.


### "I hope my death will make more cents than my life."

Arthur Fleck works as a clown, is a sad person who obeys social rules, dresses as a clown, and acts as a happy person, but indeed he is suffering. He felt better in the mental clinic than in society. 

He can relate to kids, but when it comes to adult relations, he has problems, which he resolves with compulsive laughter. You can doubt that his laugh is authentic, and It could be a way to get out of troublesome social situations. 

Arthur fantasizes about his role model Murray, Who is a father figure to him. "The Lights, The show, the audience, all that stuff, I would give up in a heartbeat to have a kid like You" - Murray says to him in his fantasies. We can see that he doesn't have a typical border between what's real and what is his imagination. His beliefs are sometimes more real for him than the reality.

The hero experiences a couple of severe traumatic events in a short time.


### "People expect you to behave as if you D@NT."

Arthur creates an imaginary relationship with one of his neighbors when she shows him a little attention.

Kills three jocks that are bullying young women in the subway, and dances with calm music in the background. Experiences tranquility. He sees that his murders grant him the time in the media and the attention he strived for.

His first appearance on stage, though interrupted by his compulsive laughter, gets him in a great mood, and he feels appreciated.


### "I thought my life was a tragedy, but now I realize It's a comedy."

Arthur learns from his mother's letter, that she thinks he is the son of Thomas Wayne. Go to Wayne's residence, where he meets young Bruce Wayne, who later will become Batman.

Murray shows his performance tape on his show and makes fun of him. Murray welcomes him to show - to presumably make jokes about him.

Visits his neighbor, who doesn't recognize him, and his only positive relation appears to be delusions.

### "My life is nothing but a comedy."

This is a period when Arthur developed a philosophy to fight back against the unjust oppression and social system. He takes revenge on people who harmed him, and arbitraryly punishes people who took or trying to take advantage of him.

Arthur accepts his Joker authentic personality and is truly happy. Don't have any remorse to kill bullies or people who oppress the weak. Every time he kills, he feels relieved.

Joker becomes his true self just before entering the Scene on Murray show.

- "Comedy is subjective muray. Isn't that what they say."
- "All of you decide what is right or wrong, in the same way. What's funny or not."
- "Why all these people are upset about these guys(...) If it was me dying on the sidewalk you would pass over me."


### A Couple of Happy Thoughts


#### Everything happens in his head

There are some good indicators that Arthur was locked in the hospital for the whole movie.
It could all happen in Arthur's head in the hospital.
The social worker who is shown at the beginning of the movie resembles a psychiatrist at the end of the movie, and Arthur has dark hair instead of light brown in the movie.
-At the beginning of a movie.  He is shown in hospital mental hospital, as in the last scene of the movie. "Do you know why you were locked in the hospital?" The social worker asks him at the start.
- Television gives him material to tell the story of his life in his head. He could imagine his whole action from the information on the TV.
  - The killings of three young men - made by some random guy dressed as a clown.
  - Thomas Wayne - who is standing for three jocks killed by the clown.
  - Identify himself as "the carnival" - his stage name, which he heard also on the radio."
  - He is in the Murray show.
- He has imaginary meetings with his neighbor.
-The hospital always appears when he meets with a psychiatrist or social worker.
- "For my whole life I didn't knew a really existed, but I do" - to a social worker when he thinks he is being recognized in the TV.

### Thomas Wayne is really Arthur Fleck's Father

 Thomas Wayne is Joker's father. Penny was working for him, and she was an attractive woman. Penny wasn't the best mother to Arthur, as one of her partners abused him(possibly Thomas Wayne). Penny tells Artur that they made her sign some papers (Probably adoption documents).
- Arthur Has a young Penny photo signed - "Love your smile T. W." - When he is doing making makeup for Muray Show. And he throws it into the trash (after killing her).
- As Penny writes to Tomhas Wayne, she taught Arthur to respond happily to negative situations. She trained Arthur to act happily in stressful and unpleasant situations.

### Comedy is subjective Murray -  different ways to make people laugh

Different sources of giving laughter to people:
- being a victim of violence.
- being an object of a joke to laugh at - from Murray.
- being a clown - from making a fool of yourself.
- being a standup comedian - when people laugh at your jokes - Arthur wants to be in this role, but He is treated as a victim.
- So he becomes a Joker - who creates subjective comedy where he is the person with power.

### A movie about attention

Arthur lacks attention. The whole movie could be about the abandonment of people mentally ill. Instead of caring, people make fun of and ostracize those, who need attention.
- Thomas Wayne - "Maybe a little attention, maybe a hug Dad.", "She's crazy."
- Murray - when he makes laugh of him and invites him to his show.
- Social Worker - when she doesn't pay attention, and says that society abandoned him.
- His mother - never pays attention to him, and doesn't know that "he never felt happy in his life".
- His co-worker - when he gives him a gun.

Arthur feels very good when he can make people laugh, and notice him.
- In Murray's show - "What do you get, when you cross a loner, with a mental illness when society abandoned him.", "You get what you, f.....g, deserve".
- In the stand-up show.
- When he fantasizes about his neighbor.
- At the end of the movie, when he dances on the top of a car.

#### Penny had a lobotomy
- You can see when Arthur reads his mother's files, a line that says "She had a lobot.."
It would explain her emotionless behavior, though it stands in contrast to her exaggerated reaction when cops are asking for Arthur.

#### Arthur often can control his laughter

- In scenes when Arthur meets cops or exits the staffroom to meet his employer he can stop laughing or control his laugh.
- He learns what's funny and what's not from standup shows - his reception of the shows seems unauthentic, and he has to take notes, of what a good joke consists of.

From the story, we can conclude, that Penny tried to make Arthur happy. If she had a lobotomy, it would be hard to tell her who is in a good or bad mood besides some obvious signs, like a smile or laugh.

Penny trained Arthur to show signs of being happy because she couldn't understand it otherwise, and she really wanted him to be happy. It is difficult to say if she hit him or if it was her partner, presumably Thomas Wayne. 

Penny doesn't respond well to aggression, so I think, that Penny hadn't beaten Arthur, and when she moved out of Wayne's residence she was trying to teach gentlest Arthur to respond positively to abuse and aggression from her partner/partners.

Penny paid a lot of attention that her son was acting happy, so much that he learned to respond with laughter or smile to unfavorable situations. And then it can be argued that his sickness doesn't cause his laugh. He can even be mentally healthy, with just personality disorders (which explains why the medicine doesn't work for him. And he takes it "not to feel bad", while he is just suffering very much)

Arthur indeed cannot control his laughter most of the time, but when he becomes Joker, he laughs when he wants. Not like Arthur who cannot control his nervous laughter.

#### Arthur wanted to commit suicide on Television

He imagined shooting himself to the head on Murray's show when he was practicing for the show. Before the show, he also pulled a gun on his head.

But when he read "I hope my death will make more cents than my life" in his diary, he understood that his suicide would profit Murray. And since he made lough of him, Arthur wouldn't want that. So he understood that Murray should be punished for treating him as, a disabled person as a victim and take profit for this.

#### It's 1986 in the movie

The police cars are rather from 70. The movie, Modern Times by Charlie Chaplin, which Thomas Wayne watches before meeting with Arthur is from the late 30s. And the Joker as a DC hero was created in 70 (I think). The music also indicates the early 70s. Black and white television is also rather from around  60'-80'. 

But when Arthur goes to the street after his stand up at Pogo's he sees a newspaper frontpage with "latest news on the murders" and a clown face, there is beneath it "exclusive - photos of disaster in Ukraine", which almost certainly refers to disaster in Chornobyl which happened in 1986.

#### Arthur wants to help society, and Joker doesn't

"I was brought to this dark world to spread joy and laughter."

When Arthur found out what happened to him, through his mother's files in Arkham Asylum, he understood that all the things he was brought up were a bunch of hypocritical lies. Therefore he REALLY didn't want to participate in this mascarade.


### Symbolism and curiosities

1. Id(Conciosu Artur), Ego(Joker), SuperEgo(social rules and his trained laugh) - Joker starts to be himself when he abandons social rules and starts acting how "he wants and feels about people."

2. His mother represents self-control and obeying the rules of society(Superego). She was the person closest to him, but lied and made him suffer. She represents the hypocrisy and the harm that social rules cause to the disabled and poor people.

3. Murray's show is always on when his mother is present - a representation of a father figure.

4. Wayne is the face of the oppressive social system and hypocrisy.

5. Rats symbolize the sickness in which the society is functioning. When Joker goes on the killing spree, the social rules are thrown out, and the riots opposing the social hierarchy start to rise.

6. Stairs are the representation of struggle. Arthur climbs heavily upwards at the beginning of the movie. As the Joker he dances down from them happily.

11. TV screens are always something of the second or third person.

7. Television, shows, and acting represent the imaginary world in which he exists the more insane he gets. In this world, everything is exaggerated, and don't have to obey social rules.

8. In the scene where Bruce meets Arthur they are wearing the same color clothes.

9. The movie is split into two parts. The first part is when Arthur is chasing kids, gets beaten by them, and struggles to climb the stairs. The second is when Joker dances off the stairs, and the detectives who are chasing him are beaten by the crowd.

10. There is something about him smoking.

12. Arthur with his mother have one bedroom with a TV, and one saloon with a TV. Both TVs are black and white, but color television existed for a long, long time.

13. Murray knew Arthur have mental problems, and this didn't stop him from making fun of him
  - Does he have sexual problems? - doctor Sally
  - He looks like he has a lot of problems - Murray

14. In the beginning of the movie Arthur, as a clown has a little hat, which isn't stolen from him by the bullying kids. Later doesn't have this hat.

15. It's quite obvious for the average American that Gotham and Arkham is an analogy for New York.


### Summary

I would recommend this movie to anyone. Not everyone will like this dark sense of humor and some dark topics. The plot isn't also the simplest, so the movie is worth more when you watch it more than once time.

If you like dark psychological movies, you will love this movie. Besides this, I think it's a masterpiece, and everyone who watches many movies should enjoy it. Otherwise, you are probably mentally healthy, and it may not be your first joice.
