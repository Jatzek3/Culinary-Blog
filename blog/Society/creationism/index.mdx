There aren't too many Creationists in the Catholic Church, because
Catholic Church respects science and doesn't force people to believe literally in everything in 
Bible. On the other hand, many protestant churches turn to Bible as the source of divine knowledge and the only truth. In the United States, many people believe that the world had been created in 6 days.

On the other hand, there is secularization in the Western world. Many people fill the place
where religion was before with science. 

In the Catholic world, religion and science can work together and complement each other. 
The distinction of sacrum and profanum has its place.

For creationists and fighting atheists, there is no separation. Creationists try to explain scientific problems with religion and claim things that are often not physically possible.
In consequence, they undermine the purely scientific worldview of atheists.

An on the other side of the fence, there are atheists/scientists, which disprove every kind of religion. 
Science is on the foundations of their beliefs. In consequence, everything which is not scientific (simplifying) is wrong. 

In my opinion, the only problem of the dispute, is not separating science from religion, and 
making religious arguments in scientific topics and vice versa making scientific claims on 
religious topics. 

In the end, it matters most for people believing in something which sources
of worldview they prefer. It doesn't change the world that someone believe or not that Darwin was right.
(It could be for a problem biologists to believe in creationism).
And does not mean anything about this person's personality.
