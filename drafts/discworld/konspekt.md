### Introduction

I started pouring priceless processing power of my brain it this game, when it was still very young. It was in february of 2014, and the game was launched in august of 2013. 

At this moment i have 1500 hours spent in the game. I imagine that for people who don't play eu4 this can seem like much. I imagine that for any peron who, have family, work, real life hobbies this can seem very much. But those people don't play EU4 and don't know what they are missing. 

If you are happy with your work, family and hobbies you shouldn't play this game. You don't have to expierience everything in your life, like drugs or Europa Universalis 4. 

### About the Europa Universalis

Europa universalis is 4X grand strategy, which means It have elemets of:
- exploration
- expansion
- exploitation
- etermination
This kind of games take very long time to finish, are very complex and practicaly impossible to master. You keep learning, about mechanics and gameplay of different nations. 

Most often the 1444, the earliest starting date is chosen. But you can pick any date from 1444 till 1821. The world situation will try to resemble the actual historical one. You can try lead eanglish colonieis to independece, or fight with whole Europe as revolutionary France.

But this custom starting date aren't chosen too often They give you less time to dominate the world, and most achievements can be earned only starting in 11 Noveber 1444. This starting date is also most polishe by the developers, since majority of games happen start from this date.

Beside of date, you have to also pick the nation. Some nation have many missions and events intersting from the start. Some nation gets expanded mission trees when certain DLC is bought. And some nations have little or no specific events or missions.

If you are a beginner, or consider buying Europa Universalis,start from the easiest nations, France, Castille, Ottomans, Poland, Muscovy. I enjoy learning of new mechanics, and there is very many things for me to learn.
