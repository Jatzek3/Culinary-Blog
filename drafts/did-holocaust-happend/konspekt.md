1. Introduction
    - the preciseness oh historical knowledge - what happend, what is propaganda
    - Can such a global event could be falsify to happen?

2. Arguments 
    - Why would Germany make holocaust?
        - bad reputation on the world
        - the administrative cost of creating such facilities
        - killing actual cheap labour to work in work camps
        - exterminating many skilled workers, lawyers doctors, proffesors
        + only the ideological side seem to speak for the holocaust
    - How the holocaust was suposedly commenced
        - Gas trucks
        - Gas chambers
        - disposing of bodies
            - crematories
            - mass graves
    - The facts
        - There where work camps for not jewish population -1,6mln notj Jewish people was regitered there, 800 thousand died
        - Cyklon B was german insectised which should be often used in simmmilar poor conditions
        - Crematories in big work camps seems reasonble since from famine, and poor living condition many people died there
        - There are no actual Nazi documents which indicates on organizing the holocaust.
    - What could happen to Jews if not shoah
        - Jews needn't to be exterminated to dissapear:\
        - they could escape from 3 reich
        - take the Identity of polish neighbours
        - They could have take new ID(as in Schindlers list)
        - They could migrate to created post-war Isreal, 
        - they could hide and survive as shown in pianist.
        - They could survive nazi work camps, as free workers.
        - Get to the polish guerilla
         And I think there are many more ways to survive which I just don't know
    - Why faking holocaust could be beneficial for The Allies
        - colaboration between Stalin and Roosvelt after Hitler took France in 1940
        - Even though Comunism can be seen as opponent for USA today, FDR preffered Stalin to Hitler.
        - Stalin quickly became huge threat for USA, and propaganda explaining why USA choose Stalin over Hitler could be very handy. If not for the holocoust USA potenctially could creates most deadly enemy, and help to get rid of it biggest opponent.

3. Docomentations
    - sources - there is no single document which would confirm holocaust. It is explained by:
        - burning the documentation, when allies was winning the war (1)
        - Hitler aversion to sign extermination documents after T4 Aktion, which was a campaign of mass murder by involuntary euthanasia in Nazi Germany(1)
    - witnesses - though no traces was found Yad Vashem, musem of names, collects testimonies of Jews who survived the concentration camps
        - The Institute for Historical Review publicly offered a reward of $50,000 for verifiable "proof that gas chambers for the purpose of killing human beings existed at or in Auschwitz." Mel Mermelstein, a survivor of Auschwitz, submitted his own testimony as proof but it was ignored. He then sued IHR in the United States and the case was subsequently settled for $50,000, plus $40,000 in damages for personal suffering. The court declared the statement that "Jews were gassed to death at the Auschwitz Concentration Camp in Poland during the summer of 1944" was a fact (1)
    
    - reparations - after war 
    - the State and Isreali institutions received reparations from 1952 West German-Isreali agreement(2)
    - It is questionable why Jews, as people who believe in certain religion should receive reparation from the Germany. Jews, presumably persecuted, was in majority of Polsh origin not Israeli, so Polnad should receive the money, for the harms, and displacement of the Jews to isreal after the war. (It's also questionable why there should be crated state of Isreal, for people of one religion in the place of it's promised land, but this is another topic).
    - Isreali goverment funded instututions and infrastucture from the money which it received from reparations.(2)

    -reparations - after 1990
    - after 1990 there was starting to be personal claims for reparations. They were few of them and holocaust survivors received very little from it (2)
