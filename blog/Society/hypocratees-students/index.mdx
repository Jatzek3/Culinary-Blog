### Introduction

Ałbena Grabowska is a Polish woman with Bulgarian roots. A neurologist with a second degree of specialization (highest degree of specialization in Polish medicine ) and Ph. D. In the past she was dedicated solely to her patients (especially to those with epilepsy). For nine years she has been the author of books for children and adults. She gladly writes books in different genres. She wrote "Stulecie Winnych" on which basis a movie was created, and drama novels like "Kosci proroka" and "Matki i córki". She lives with her three children, four cats, and one dog.

### Trilogy

The trilogy "Students of hypocrates", consists of "Doktor Bogumił", "Doktor Anna" and "Doktor Zosia" and is linked by several features. 
- They share the same timeline, from the XIX century "Doctor Bogumił" till the end of the Second World War, which end concludes the third tome of the trilogy "Doktor Zosia".
- The action takes place in Warsaw and concentrates on healthcare institutions, people who are in need, and doctors, who manage and work in those institutions.
- Books tell the history of medicine, in the time when major scientific breakthroughs happened. This period (XIX century - to the end of world war) was crucial for medicine and healthcare. 
- Ałbena Grabowska tries to show us what struggles had to overcome women and innovators. The progress was so fast that few of the intellectual elite could catch up with them. Often new inventions met opposition from other doctors. The other side of this was that women still didn't have equal rights with men, and it was seldom sought that a woman would become a doctor. Entrance for women to this profession was difficult or even forbidden. 


### Summary

The subject of the books should be attractive to educated women. Even though there are strong feminist tones, the book is entertaining, and I read every tome in just a few days. Every book has around five hundred pages, and it was a pleasure to read those engaging lectures.
