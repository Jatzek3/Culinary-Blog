### Introduciton
Carnivale is two season-long series, which takes place in the northwest USA in the 1930s. Though it was critically acclaimed, the show was canceled after two seasons. It had a massive budget per episode(4mln$), which didn't correspond to amount of viewers. The production tried to cut the costs to two million dollars, but the creators hadn't agreed. Carnivale was to last six seasons. Unfortunately, this fabulous show had been canceled early, so the dissolution of the action could be reasonable for the viewer.

The series has a distinct climate. It's dark and dirty; fitting times of the great depression and moods in modernistic written culture. The cast of Michael J. Anderson(Twin Peaks) fits well 
with the story and gives this fast spontaneous reference to Twin Peaks. He fit very well in this role, and I was surprised that he didn't played in more movies in his career. I was happy to see Adrienne Barbeau. She's not the most famous actress, but if you see some movies with her, she will be recognizable to you. Clancy Brown did a great thing playing his role, and Tim DeKay was a well-played side character. I didn't like acting main character(Ben Hawkins), played by Nick Stahl, and a couple of other side characters.

### The show
Carnivale has rich cultural and historic background. Events of the series happen at the time of the Great Depression, on still undeveloped lands of the West Coast of the USA. Though there is an entire movie genre, about the earlier years of this land (Western). There aren't too many works of art about this period and place. Carnivale fills that void to some extent. 

The Great Depression started in the United States in 1929. Though it ended about 1933, the economy in many places didn't was still crumbled. That shades the decade and has its repercussions on all the Western world. It's well depicted with the dirty aesthetics of Carnivale and is often reminded in historical inserts.
The place and occupation of heroes also call for attention. The action takes place near Hollywood. Heroes are acting in spectacles and shows. This places them close to actors in yet undeveloped movie industry.

The climate of the Interwar Period is characterized by dark and mysterious tones. The First World War brought terror to Western World, which had never been seen before. Many writers created upon these experiences. That led to a filthy, cynical worldview, which was powered by The Great Depression and poverty. 
The lack of workplaces created the place for Freakshows. In the USA, a group of disabled or deformed people would travel and show themselves for a fee. A season of American Horror Story tells a story of a Freakshow, which is close to the climate of Carnivale.

In the contemporary culture where death was so common, the supernatural and mystical beliefs were a natural consequence. People found occupation in mystical or death-related trades. In Carnivale, we see "Death Mask Creator". There were also "Death Photographers" and "Mediums", the last is a common topic of the art today. 

But death does not only leads people to these dark and filthy beliefs. It was also a possibility to find hope and faith. In the USA more than in Europe, mass media, social mobility, and new inventions had come to help people in need. Some people had taken advantage of it, and the dark character of Carnivale portrays it. The main adversary uses lies and aggression to accomplish his goals. He is depicted as a charismatic, cynical character. The opposite is what should a preacher or priest should represent.

### Summary 
Carnivale is a great show, and it was for me a disappointment that it ended so early. I would recommend the show if you like dark climate and filthy atmosphere, and history and culture. The plot of the series is not its biggest strength, but you would have to judge yourself. If you prefer family-friendly leisure, it is not the best title for you.
