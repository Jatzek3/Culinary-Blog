I tried to fix the speed of my 1Mb/s connection. In result of that
I reset the settings of my router and cannot connect to the internet again.

I read another chapter of JavaScript: definitive guide. About events.
Many outdated things abut browser compatybility wasn't so interesting.
But i refreshed my knowledge about some, and I still have doubts if 
I understand bubling and capturing correctly. 

The events part gave me some usefull insights, becouse in react DOM manpiulation
isn't used as much. Its becouse of, problems with memory managment when there is badly 
written code, and React attitude towards components, and updating them.
