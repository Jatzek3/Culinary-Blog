### Serivngs: 2

Lately, I have done some peanut butter in a mixer from walnuts.
It came out bitter since I didn't remove their skin off them. A little bit 
of sugar removed the bitter taste from my walnut butter. It was still very 
fat and hard to eat in larger amounts. So I come up with an idea, to make 
a pork stew with it. Then I reminded myself that my friend 
Sebastian made me quite the same dish, and it tasted great.

You don't have to make peanut butter on your own, store-bought is ok. You lose control of the sweetness of your dish. If you have the 
possibility, then try out making some.

### Ingredients:

- 400 grams of pork - ham would be the best
- 2 cloves of garlic crushed
- 1/2 cup(100ml) of peanut butter
- 1cm of ginger, finely grated
- 2 peperoncino peppers, finely grated, or a teaspoon of hot pepper flakes(5g)
- 2 tablespoons of soy sauce
- salt, pepper

### Method:

1. Mix ginger, soy sauce, peanut butter, garlic, pepper flakes with 
about 150ml of water. Add salt and pepper according to taste. Coat the pork with the mixture.
2. Put it in the fridge to marinate overnight.
3. Put everything in a pot on high. Bring it up to boil, then 
reduce the heat to low. Cover the pot with a lid.
4. Cook for one and a half an hour on low. 
5. Taste best with basmati rice. 

Enjoy your meal :)

### Footnotes
- experiment with the mixture of spices till you get a taste that suits you best.
I made my peanut butter slightly different than the store-bought are, be mindful of this.
- Remember that the sauce should have a sharp taste. When the dish is done the taste will split with the pork and rice.
