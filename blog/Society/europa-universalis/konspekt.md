### Introduction

I started pouring the priceless processing power of my brain it this game when it was still very young. It was in February 2014, and the game launched in August 2013. 

At this moment, I have 1500 hours spent in the game. I imagine that for people who don't play eu4, this may seem like much. For any person who has family, work, and real-life hobbies, this may seem very much. But those people don't play EU4 and don't know what they are missing. 

If you are happy with your work, family, and hobbies you shouldn't play this game. You don't have to experience everything in your life, like drugs or Europa Universalis 4. 

### About the Europa Universalis

Europa Universalis is 4X grand strategy, which means It has elements of:
- exploration
- expansion
- exploitation
- extermination
This kind of game takes a very long time to finish, is very complex, and is almost impossible to master. You constantly learn the mechanics and gameplay of different nations. 

Most often, in the 1444 year, the earliest starting date is chosen. But you can pick any date from 1444 to 1821. The game will try to resemble the actual historical one. You can try to lead English colonies to independence, or fight with the whole of Europe as revolutionary France.

But this custom starting date isn't chosen too often. It gives you less time to dominate the world, and most achievements can be earned only starting on 11 November 1444. This starting date is also most polished by the developers since the majority of players choose it.

Besides the date, you have also to pick the nation. Some nations have many missions and events from the start. Some nations get expanded mission trees when DLC is bought. And some have little or no specific events or missions.

If you are a beginner or consider buying Europa Universalis, start from the easiest nations, France, Castille, Ottomans, Poland, and Muscovy. 

### Summary

The game is a great experience and very educational. You can learn many non-europocentric facts. And this is hard to come by. It requires massive amounts of hours, but it is very fun.
