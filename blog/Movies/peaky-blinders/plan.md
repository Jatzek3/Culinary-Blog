### Introduction

Did you ever wanted to travel back in time....?
Peaky blinders show on screen how this reality would look.Thankfully we dont have to live in interwar Birmingham. Where Peaky blinders are taking us for whole six seasons.

We can happily watch the peripeteia of the heroes in our home. Far away from the dangers of early XX century industrail town,hich is shown very accurately. Both from historical point of view, as for plot Peaky Blinders are filmed remarkably. 

Cilian Murphy stars, as the thead of Shelby gang. I like him very much, and always fail to remember his name. This time he creates a kinda cult of His and His family gang. 
Other well played characters are:
    - Artur Shelby(Paul Anderson). 
    - Alfie Solomons(Tom Hardy) which with the role from Taboo,created this dark and resourcefull persona 
    - Aberama Gold(Aidan Gillen), which played "littlefinger" in Games of thrones

The series have been, received overpassing any expectation. So well that there people started giving heroes names to thier children. So there would be more Tommys, Arthurs and Ada's since the serieas was aired.

#### The world 

Tom Shelby is the head of a gang of peaky blinders. They have the name from using razors to cut their enemies forhead, so the blood will flow on the eyes and blind themn. The series series of engaments beetween the gang and other gangs, the United Kingdom, ethinc minorities and other diffrent parties. Tom is not alone in his endeavors, and most often can count on support of his families and allies. 

The show is quite accurate historically and most of the other groups have existed as well as the Peaky Blinders. THere is quite a big attention to detail in that matter, so even the cloathes of Peaky Blinders has been adjusted to the orignals. 

The world is believable, and looks simmilar to what you could expect from this period of time in England. The plot though is entirely make up and facts are  often in service of the story. Historical events have miningfull impact, but the story isn't driven by them.

### Summary 

I suggest to watch peaky blinders. The series echoed in the popculture, and not without the reason. Strong sides of Peaky Blinders are historical accuracy, the plot and marvelous acting. 

All Shelby characters and some of the rivalring groups characters are created almost without flaws. Individuaolity and character development are great advantage. 

There is also a lot of good music, especially for Radiohead and Nick Cage fans.
