Thanks to my colleague recommendation, quite good fluency
in Python, for the time of learning and some basic knowledge 
about computer science I got my first job as a software engineer.

I think that I had to little understanding about network administration
and low level programming for the time. Even though work didn't provide me
with many challenges and I really put big effort into my job, 
my more experienced colleagues gave me reviews at the end of my trial period.

Based on this, i think my boss didn't have the choice to prupose me
prolongation of the contract, so our cooperation come to an end.
