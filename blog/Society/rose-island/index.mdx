The Republic of Rose Island was a very short-lived micronation.
It wasn't commonly recognizable.
People from Rimini told the story, about the Rose Island,
to their children, and the children then passed the story to 
their children. So Rose Island was only locally known. 
Until Netflix created a movie about it in 2020.

Netflix movie shows a one-sided version of the story.
So it can be easily digested by the viewer. In reality, it omits
an important part of building the Island. It was difficult 
to do such a thing. 
Giorgios's character, in other sources, is characterized as very strict and thorough. Which is very far from what the movie portrays.

Giorgio Rosa wanted to build "L'Isola Delle Rose" as a symbol of freedom.
He managed to achieve it, with the help of four friends and some workers. It took him half of the year 1967.

The government of Italy had seen this as a way to omit taxes. The bigger 
the effort of the government to shut down the Island, the more attention
Island got. Giorgio Rosa didn't want to succumb to the persuasion
of the Italian government. As in the movie, they tried to bribe him. 
They accused him of cooperating with the Soviets.

In the end, the Island got destroyed, a year after it was built. For more information ->
