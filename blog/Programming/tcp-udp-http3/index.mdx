tl;dr: TCP is slow but accurate, UDP is fas,t but it loses data.
HTTP3 uses UDP in a way(QUIC) that mitigates its drawbacks.


### Introduction

Lately, I have written an article about the HTTP protocol.
https://theyellowpages.live/blog/http/
HTTP is in 7 application layer of the OSI(Open System Interconnect)
model. This model helps professionals to understand problems and 
conceptualize thoughts. This model has the following layers:

- Layer 7 - Application - about this layer of internet connection, you can read in the above mention HTTP article.
- Layer 6 - Presentation.
- Layer 5 - Session.
- Layer 4 - Transport - This will be the main topic of this post.
- Layer 3 - Network.
- Layer 2 - Data Link.
- Layer 1 - Physical.

### TCP 

Transmission Control Protocol work in client-server mode. Server awaits connection
with the client on a proper port. 
TCP is connection-oriented, so the connection has to be established before data can be sent.
TCP guarantees delivery of all complete packets, in an appropriate order,  without duplicates.

To make a connection three-way handshake procedure is used.
- Host A (client) - sends to Host B(server) SYN segment. And change its state to SYN-SENT 
- Host B (server) - after receiving the SYN segment, change its state to SYN-RECEIVED. 
If Host B wants to make a connection with Host A, he sends him SYN and ACK segments.
- Host A - after receiving SYN and ACK, changes its state to ESTABLISHED. Then sends ACK to Host B.
- Host B - changes state to ESTABLISHED.
- Host A - Can now transfer the data.

The TCP layer is responsible for making sure that all bytes received will be in identical order, as the sent one. Since not always it is possible, in a simple way, TCP handles it with "positive acknowledgment with retransmission". When the receiver will get the packet,
he sends an acknowledgment to the sender. The sender keep track of every packet sent, and if he won't receive an acknowledgment, within a certain time, he assumes it's lost and retransmits it.

Data transfer:
- Ordered data transfer: the destination host rearranges segments according to a sequence number.
- Retransmission of lost packets: any cumulative stream not acknowledged is retransmitted.
- Error-free data transfer: corrupted packets are treated as lost and are retransmitted.
- Flow control: limits the rate a sender transfers data to guarantee reliable delivery.
- Congestion control: lost packets (presumed due to congestion) trigger a reduction in data delivery rate.

At the lower layer of the OSI model stack, due to various factors, some packets may be lost, delivered out of order, or duplicated. TCP detects these faults and requests 
retransmission of the data. TCP specializes in an accurate, delivery, and long delays are possible. 
Therefore it is not suitable for real-time applications.

TCP is adopted in programs that use application layer protocols such as HTTP, SSH, FTP, SMTP/POP3, or IMAP.

### UDP

User Datagram Protocol, unlike TCP, uses connectionless communication. It has no handshaking
dialog and therefore exposes user's programs to any unreliability of the network. There is no 
guarantee of delivering, ordering, or duplicate protection. UDP is fast and time-sensitive 
applications often are using UDP, since missing packets is preferable to delay.

UDP is especially suited for certain applications:
- It is transaction-oriented, suitable for simple query-response protocols such as the Domain Name System
- It provides datagrams, suitable for modeling other protocols such as IP tunneling or remote procedure call and the Network File System.
- It is simple, suitable for bootstrapping or other purposes without a full protocol stack, such as the DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol)
- It is stateless, suitable for very large numbers of clients, such as in streaming media applications such as IPTV.
- The lack of retransmission delays makes it suitable for real-time applications such as Voice over IP or online games.
- Because it supports multicast, it is suitable for broadcast information such as in many 
kinds of service discovery and shared information such as Precision Time Protocol and Routing Information Protocol.

Lacking reliability, UDP applications may encounter some packet loss, reordering, errors, or duplication.
Some mechanisms add a little reliability but are rarely used. 

### QUIC

Is a general-purpose transport layer network protocol, which improves
the performance of connection-oriented web applications, which currently are using TCP.
It uses by creating many UDP connections between two endpoints. It's designed to 
obsolete TCP, thus earning an occasional nickname "TCP/2"

Some of the upgrades which were implemented in QUIC:
- It aims to be nearly equivalent to a TCP connection but with much-reduced latency.
- It  optimizes the speed of the initial connection, by ensuring secure connection (with TLS)
on an initial handshake. 
- It uses UDP underneath instead of TCP. This doesn't lead
to losing data in transmission. Thanks to using many streams, if an error occurs on one stream, other streams can transmit data separately. 
- it improves performance during network switches. For example, when traveling with a mobile device,
when the network switches from a Wi-Fi hotspot to a mobile network in TCP a lengthy process starts.
QUIC solves this problem.

HTTP/3 was created to use the QUIC. And ss of December 2021 is still in "Internet Draft" phase,
 but is already supported by 73% of web browsers
