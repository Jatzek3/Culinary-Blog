A Tulip Fever was the first noted example of a speculative bubble
in history. It is more interesting than the object of the
bubble didn't have any rational worth besides its beauty. Tulip bulbs
were traded between people which were hobbyists of seeding and trading these flowers. There weren't many reasons to be anxious for a long time
but when Tulip traders began using futures contracts as a tool
that allow them to sell a bulb that matures later and restricted
the rights to offspring of most valuable bulbs to certain people
the price quickly started to raise. On this wave of madness, people started
buying bulbs for-profit and borrowing money to buy them, and later
sell them for profit. The boom couldn't last forever and one day
the bubble broke and prices fell in a very sudden way.

This is an outline of how the speculative bubble may work. Often the mechanism behind price growth is different but the cycle is very similar. This is the background of the movie Tulip Fever, in a plot of which
the bubble is interwoven. Besides, that movie shows very realistic
scenery of 1636-1637 dutch city. The plot resembles me works
of William Shakespeare, where comedy and tragedy went hand in hand.
Overall very beautiful movie, with very good roles of experienced 
actors (Christopher Waltz, Judi Dench) and interesting roles of 
Alicia Vikander and Dane DeHaan.
